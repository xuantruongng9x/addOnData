Right now the addon adds only 5 new fluids but I?m going to add more soon!\nOne of the two fluids this addon adds is honey! It?s sticky and if you go in it you will be slowed down. All the fluids (6 fluids) are not craftable yet but will be in the future! Also, the fluids are blocks, not entities.\nHere is what the honey looks like on the ground.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4969/images/more-fluids-addon_2.png"},{"text":"Here Is what it looks like when you put it in the air.\nlike water or lave it can flow down.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4969/images/more-fluids-addon_3.png"},{"text":"And finally, here it is flowing!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4969/images/more-fluids-addon_4.png"},{"text":"The second fluid added in this addon is milk! Like the honey, it cannot be crafted yet, but will be in future updates. If you step in it will slow you but not as much as the honey fluid.\nHere is the milk fluid on the ground!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4969/images/more-fluids-addon_5.png"},{"text":"Here is the milk flowing and in the air.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4969/images/more-fluids-addon_6.png"},{"text":"The third fluid in this addon is the Ender Fluid! It is like milk, and It also does not have a crafting recipe. The one difference is that if you step in the ender fluid you get a levitation effect.\nHere is what the ender fluid looks like!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4969/images/more-fluids-addon_7.png"},{"text":"The fourth fluid is mud! Mud is like the placeable honey fluid. It is slower than the milk. Right now mud does not do anything special but will in the future!\nHere is what the mud looks like!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4969/images/more-fluids-addon_8.png"},{"text":"The next fluid is the acid! The acid speed is like the milk but it does some new things. One of the new things it does is dissolve dirt and grass! If you place it on grass or dirt it will dissolve it! Be careful because it can get laggy. If it does get laggy type this command /kill @e[tag\u003dfluid]\nHere is what the acid does! You can see what it looks like in-game\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4969/images/more-fluids-addon_9.png"},{"text":"The final fluid is oil! The oil speed is like the honey. Right now, oil does not do anything special, but it will in the future!\nHere is what the oil looks like.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4969/images/more-fluids-addon_10.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/more-fluids-addon_1-1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/addons/4969/MoreFluidsAddonV0.3.zip"},{"href":"https://mcpedl.com/leaving?url\u003dhttp%3A%2F%2Fraboninco.com%2F1z5xt\u0026post_id\u003d156816"},{"href":"https://mcpedl.com/leaving?url\u003dhttp%3A%2F%2Fraboninco.com%2F1z60C\u0026post_id\u003d156816"}],"uploadedBy":"Minicookie1811","uploadedAt":"1 Sep, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.16.100"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/more-fluids-addon/"}]
