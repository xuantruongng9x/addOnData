This time being the Windcaller. The Windcaller was first introduced in a teaser for the Howling Peaks DLC in the MC Dungeons game and became available over the past week. My theory is that Minecraft is trying to establish elemental Illagers into the game first being the Geomancer (an illager that controls rocks from the ground) and now the Windcaller which if you haven?t guessed yet, controls the wind. Both of these illagers have dark purple eyes unlike the others in their kind. Hopefully, we get to see a fire type and a water type in the game?s upcoming DLCs the Nether DLC and the Ocean DLC.\nThe Windcaller has two attacks just like the original. He creates a little tornado under your feet and lifts you up into the air. In his other attack, he will spin his staff around and summon a gust of wind that can damage multiple mobs.\nThe Windcaller ? 30\nThe Windcaller will spawn in extreme hills biomes since in the MC Dungeons game that?s where he is featured.\nThe Updraft Tome, ?An ancient book filled with illegible glyphs, you feel a strange breeze as you flip the pages.? ? in-game description.
