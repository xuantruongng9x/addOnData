HP: 30, Attack Damage: 6 (+ Fatal Poison Effect for 5 seconds on hit )\nThese mobs are like the smaller cave spiders except that they can be found anywhere and inflict fatal poison. Don?t be caught off guard!\nMummy ? HP: 40, Attack Damage: 8 (+ Wither Effect for 5 seconds on hit)\nThese mobs can only be found in the desert and even then they are fairly rare. They inflict a wither attack as they attempt to drain the life out of you.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4601/images/bedrock-plus_6.png"},{"text":"Volatile Creeper ? HP: 30, Explosion Power: 2, Fuse: Instant (+ Causes Fire)\nThis mob is faster and has more health than a regular creeper. More importantly, it will explode in flames instantly as soon as it is within melee range. To balance things out a little I have reduced the power of the explosion. Its fuse will also trigger as it walks around ready to explode, so you should hear it coming?\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4601/images/bedrock-plus_17.png"},{"text":"Withered Archer ? HP:30, Slightly Increased Arrow Damage (+ Wither Effect on hit)\nThis mob can be found throughout the Nether, in addition to regular skeletons. I?ve included a wither effect like their stone sword wielding cousins, and their own unique model which features a 3D quiver.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4601/images/bedrock-plus_24.png"},{"text":"NEW Soul Skeleton ? HP:30, Increased Arrow Damage\nThese mobs now replace regular skeletons in Soul Sand Valley. They function exactly the same, just with a new model and skin which is more fitting to their setting.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4601/images/bedrock-plus_25.png"},{"text":"Skeleton Guard ? HP:40, Attack 8 (+ Burning Effect on hit)\nThese mobs can be found anywhere in the Nether, but they are also now summoned by Skeleton Lords. I?m still working on a defensive mechanic for them?\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4601/images/bedrock-plus_21.png"},{"text":"Infected Pigman ? HP: 40, Attack 8 (+ Poison Effect for 3 seconds on hit)\nThese poor Pigmen have spent too long being exposed to the strange fungi growing in the Nether. It has now started to corrupt their decomposing bodies, causing them to release poison when attacking. Luckily for you though, other Zombie Pigmen will not be provoked when you attack Infected Pigmen.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4601/images/bedrock-plus_26.png"},{"text":"Improved Texture Lost Skeleton ?HP:40, Attack 8 (+ Wither Effect for 10 seconds on hit)\nThese mobs behave like regular Wither Skeletons, but can be found more widely throughout the Nether. They carry their scabbard on their back.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4601/images/bedrock-plus_27.png"},{"text":"NEW Fire Bat ? HP:5, Small Fireball Attack\nFound in the Nether, these new mobs are mostly quite weak, attacking with a small fireball when you come too close. They do tend to spawn in groups of 2 or 3 so be careful not to underestimate them. (Don?t forget to run a repeating command block in your world to show those fire particles!)\nExtra Strong Mobs\nThe following mobs are stronger than regular mobs and have a life bar which also indicates what type of attacks they inflict.\nWild Ravager ? HP: 75, Attack Damage: 12\nAs the untamed version of their domesticated counterparts, Wild Ravagers may appear more friendly but don?t be fooled. They will continually try to charge at you and have extra health.\nZombie Soldier ? HP: 60, Attack Damage: 9\nThis zombie type is much larger than regular zombies, has more health, does more damage and has greater reach than other mobs.\nDefective Golem ? HP: 75, Attack Damage: 6, Explosion Power: 4 (Fuse: 3 seconds)\nOnce in a while an Iron Golem will take such a punishing from the endless onslaught of zombies and skeletons that it will start to malfunction and become unstable. This mob?s arms no longer function, so instead it will relentlessly charge at you and if it takes enough damage it will explode.\nSkeleton Lord ? HP: 75, Attack Damage: 12 (+ Burning \u0026 Slowness Effect)\nThese mobs can only be found in the Nether. Besides being larger than regular skeletons and having extra health, they inflict a slow effect whilst doing burning damage. They now also summon up to 2 Skeleton Guards every 15 seconds so watch out!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4601/images/bedrock-plus_10.png"},{"text":"Pillager Assassin ? HP: 65, Attack Damage: 9 (+Slowness Effect), Teleports\nThese specialist Pillagers work alone, with the soul purpose of hunting you down. Don?t let their eye patch fool you, for as a battle-hardened veteran, they can spot you from much further than regular mobs. When within melee range they will randomly teleport whilst attacking you with their dagger. Their skill with a blade allows them to slow you down as they continually change position.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4601/images/bedrock-plus_28.png"},{"text":"NEW Alpha Piglin ? HP: 75, Attack Damage: 12 (+Knockback Effect), Can aggro any surrounding enemies.\nSometimes a piglin comes along that is simply larger, stronger and downright meaner than the rest. These ?Alpha? Piglins have managed to amass considerably more gold than the others, which they love to show off, whilst attempting to gain even more. Notice their golden horned helmet, their golden tipped tusks, their golden earring and of course their large golden battle-axe. On their own they are dangerous enough, but be careful! Alpha Piglins have such a commanding presence that they can rally any nearby enemies to fight for them.\nBlack Bear ? HP: 30, Attack Damage: 6\nFor now this is the only extra neutral/passive mob I?ve added. It uses the Polar Bear model with a modified texture and spawns in forests.\nThere?s also new recipes I?ve added so that the new weapons the mobs drop can be of some use. You?ll notice that these weapons are stackable so as to not take up too much space. You?ll also notice that they are very weak (ie 15 or so hits to kill a zombie), which is intentional. However a few can be recrafted to do decent damage.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4601/images/bedrock-plus-by-talthompson_12.png"},{"text":"Poisoned branches will give you a stick when crafted as above.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4601/images/bedrock-plus_8.png"},{"text":"Scorched Stone Picks will give you 2 pieces of coal.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4601/images/bedrock-plus_29.png"},{"text":"An Assassin?s Dagger will give you two pieces of flint (or you can now wield it yourself)\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4601/images/bedrock-plus_23.png"},{"text":"9 Worn Ancient Swords can be combined to make 1 Netherite Scrap.

But what if some of these mobs also made their way to the Bedrock Edition?

They all have their own unique AIs and will behave somewhat similar to what you see on Java. Enjoy it!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4762/images/unused-java-edition-mobs_2.png"},{"text":"The first one we will be looking at is the Killer Bunny. In case you don?t know, it is a reference to the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog from the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which already makes it an interesting mob! But don?t let the fact that it?s a rabbit fool you, as it is very hostile and will attack you! It has two methods of attack, it will either perform short but rapid hops towards you or will occasionally charge towards you very fast. It has 20 health points, deals 8 damage per attack and sometimes will not take knockback when you attack it, making this a fairly challenging foe! It also attacks wolves and foxes without being scared by them, don?t let your dogs near one as it will easily take them out! You might find Killer Bunnies spawning in Jungle biomes.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4762/images/unused-java-edition-mobs_3.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4762/images/unused-java-edition-mobs_4.png"},{"text":"The next mob we will look at is the Illusioner! Being a member of the Illager army, it is aggressive towards both you and villagers. This Illager is incredibly fast, teleports around and will attack both you and villagers by casting a blindness effect onto you and spawning duplicates which fire arrows, so it?s quite tough! It has 32 health points, and might drop arrows if defeated. The Illusioner will not spawn naturally in the world, but it might make for a fine addition for creative maps!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4762/images/unused-java-edition-mobs_5.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4762/images/unused-java-edition-mobs_7.png"},{"text":"The final mob added by this addon is the Giant. It is? well? a giant zombie. Nothing too interesting, isn?t it? While it may not be that much of a unique and interesting concept, it makes up for that in strength! The Giant will attack you and villagers in the same fashion as a regular zombie, but deals insane amounts of damage! The Giant will one shot you if you don?t have at least diamond armor, and is able to kill iron golems in only two hits so you might want really good gear if you try to fight it. Even if you have Netherite gear, it can kill you in two hits, I recommend a ranged weapon against it. It has 100 health points, and deals 50 damage per attack. The Giant spawns extremely rarely anywhere in the overworld. The Giant can even spawn with armor and weapons, which only makes it even more powerful!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/4762/images/unused-java-edition-mobs_8.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unused-java-edition-mobs_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/addons/4762/1604343017304.mcaddon"}],"uploadedBy":"An Epic gamer","uploadedAt":"20 Aug, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.16","1.16.100"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/unused-java-edition-mobs/"},{"title":"Creepypasta AlexBrine","briefDescription":"This creature does not bother players, but it scares players, but the herobrine animal can kill players and this creature can also make all kinds ...","Description":"","crawledImageUrls":[{"text":"This creature does not bother players, but it scares players, but the herobrine animal can kill players and this creature can also make all kinds of structures such as red torches, peramids, tunnels in deep mines, and also remove leaves and it can kick players\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5972/images/creepypasta-alexbrine_2.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/creepypasta-alexbrine_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/addons/5972/AlexBrine-V.0.1.mcaddon"},{"href":"https://www.mediafire.com/download/d5kw7frkk9qidd4"}],"uploadedBy":"LineGamePLAY","uploadedAt":"3 Nov, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.16"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/creepypasta-alexbrine-addon/"},{"title":"QUTEanimals ADD-ON","briefDescription":"This add-on adds 2 qute little animal on your Minecraft world for now in future more animals added like for now we have beaver and squirrel ...","Description":"","crawledImageUrls":[{"text":"This add-on adds 2 qute little animal on your Minecraft world for now in future more animals added like for now we have beaver and squirrel they?re friendly they won?t hurt anyone\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5882/images/quteanimals-addon_7.png"},{"text":"If you kill them they will drop 5 sticks but don?t kill them!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5882/images/beaver-addon_3.png"},{"text":"They are roaming around the river and are very friendly.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5882/images/beaver-addon_4.png"},{"text":"You can breed them using carrots like you do with pigs.
