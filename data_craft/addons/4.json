Well with this add-on there will be no need for that. Dynamic lighting, some glowing mobs and more, this add-on has it all.\nDynamic Lighting Plus is an add-on that adds, well, dynamic lighting. Dynamic lighting basically means that when you hold certain items, then the area around you will light up. It is a very useful feature.\nThese items will activate Dynamic Lighting when held:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5849/images/dynamic-lighting-plus_2.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5849/images/dynamic-lighting-plus_4.png"},{"text":"Well yes, pretty much what it says on the tin.

And don?t forget to dress the part with Robes and a magical Staff.\nThis addon is made for mage roleplay maps, but the recipes were designed with an eye towards being balanced in Survival gameplay.\nSpellCrafting:\nThe art of casting spells start with Spell Dust. Crafting Spell Dust requires Redstone Dust and Lapis Lazuli directly above each other (in either order).\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6476/images/spellcraft_13.png"},{"text":"Once you have Spell Dust, you can craft a Blank Spell with 1 Spell Dust and 1 Paper above each other; the dust must be on top.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6476/images/spellcraft_7.png"},{"text":"You?ll also want to make a few Spell Gems. Just toss a lone Spell Dust into the crafting grid. Spell Gems can also be turned back into Spell Dust the same way.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6476/images/spellcraft_8.png"},{"text":"Once you have a Blank Spell and dust and gems to charge it with, you can craft a spell. Place the Blank Spell in the top-left corner of the crafting grid and place Dust and/or Gems near it; every combination of dust/gems in the 2?2 box is a different valid spell, so experiment to find all 26 spells.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6476/images/spellcraft_14.png"},{"text":"Once you have a spell, just hold it and use it (right-click). A moment later, the spell?s effect will occur. When you use a spell, the Blank Spell is returned to you, so you can use it again.\nStaffCrafting:\nCrafting a magical staff is a bit of a process, but the result is quite powerful.\nFirst, you need to make the blank Wood Staff. Build it like a shovel, but with a Spell Gem on the tip:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6476/images/spellcraft_10.png"},{"text":"Then, you need a Compact Dust and a Compact Gem. To make a Compact item, put four of the normal version in a square; putting a Compact item in the grid alone returns the four items that went in.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6476/images/spellcraft_15.png"},{"text":"Once you have a Wood Staff and one of each Compact item, the last piece you?ll need is any spell that used only a single Dust or Gem; there are 6 such spells, so just pick one and fill the crafting grid like this:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6476/images/spellcraft_16.png"},{"text":"The resulting staff can be used to cast that spell. Using it results in the staff becoming drained; to recharge a drained staff, put it in the crafting grid alone (recharging is free).\nAlternatively, two Wood Staves on top of each other makes a Battle Staff (a useful weapon).\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6476/images/spellcraft_17.png"},{"text":"RobeCrafting:\nA mage naturally needs robes to look the part. By crafting armor out of purple wool, you can make cloth robes, which are slightly better than leather, but not as durable.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6476/images/spellcraft_18.png"},{"text":"By surrounding robes with Spell Dust, you can make Magic Robes, which are roughly on par with Iron Armor, but are far more enchantable.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6476/images/spellcraft_19.png"},{"text":"Other Notes:\nOnce you have Spell Dust, you can use it to corrupt other dust items, like sugar or glowstone dust. Put one Spell Dust above and below the target. Rarer dusts produce more Spell Dust. Do note that corrupting Sugar means you can farm Spell Dust.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6476/images/spellcraft_20.png"},{"text":"Compact Gems/Dust can be compacted further into Cubes by building a 2?2 pattern of them.
