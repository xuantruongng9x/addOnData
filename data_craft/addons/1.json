It also fixes the flickering texture issue on player armour and tweaks one of the recipes so that iron, diamond and netherite armour follow more of a tiered progression. It now also adds extra 3d details to the armour models.\nFirstly I?d like to acknowledge upfront that although this mod has been made from scratch entirely by me, I have gained inspiration from other texture mods that can be found on Java edition. I thought Bedrock needed more armour mods like this, as most of them seem to be focused on PVP texture packs.\nMy key inspiration has come from an old (9 years ago) but excellent pack made by Poisonheaded. (here?s a link) As you can see my textures follow a similar style to theirs, but I have used the vanilla armour textures as a base and then made my own tweaks from there. The end result is pretty different (and more detailed) I would argue, and I have also created my own matching icons.\nAnyway, now to the armour sets.\nAll the new armour textures have their new icon as shown:\n(Note: the leather armour icons will still change colour when dyed)\nLeather Armour:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6683/images/tals-armour-rework_25.png"},{"text":"Dyed Leather Armour:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6683/images/tals-armour-rework_26.png"},{"text":"Golden Armour:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6683/images/tals-armour-rework_27.png"},{"text":"Chain Armour:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6683/images/tals-armour-rework_28.png"},{"text":"The iron, diamond and netherite armours now follow a tiered progression as seen below.\nIron Armour:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6683/images/tals-armour-rework_29.png"},{"text":"Diamond Armour:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6683/images/tals-armour-rework_30.png"},{"text":"(It now has diamonds set into each of the armour pieces and adds wrist-plates.)\nNetherite Armour:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6683/images/tals-armour-rework_32.png"},{"text":"(The Netherite Armour retains the diamonds but now offers more protection to the face, the wrist plates are now gauntlets and the boots are taller.
