Each bot will need a Bot chip to tell it what job to do.\n# First Bot\nOnce you craft your first bot you can place it down. You will need to feed it redstone to turn it on. Once it is turneded on it will follow you if you hold redstone in your hand.

If you want a Guard Bot to stop following you sneak click on the guard bot to make it sit. The Guard bot will hold it?s ground. Guard Bots will attack any nearby enemies, or any mob that attacks them or the player.\nGuard Bots will also target any mob that you attack. You can drop weapons on the ground and the Guard Bot will pick them up and equip it. You can give it a sword or a bow. They will upgrade the weapon they are holding if a better one is available for them to pick up. This also works for armor, you just cant see the armor they are wearing.\nYou can ride Guard Bots into battle no saddle needed. You can control the Guard Bots direction by holding a bow in your hand. While riding a Guard bot you can access its inventory. Give a Guard Chip to a Walker Bot to make a Guard bot.\n#Miner Bot\nMiner bots are mostly useful for caving. They will follow you even if you are not holding redstone or redstone flakes. Miner bots won?t do all the work for you but they will help. They will follow you around collecting blocks dropped from mining. They will mine ores if they can path find to them. They will place torches down if they are in a dark area.\nWhen riding a Miner bot the controls are the same as riding a horse. Riding a Miner Bot will put it into drill mode. Walk into a wall to drill through it. This is where having more than one is a good idea. One can place torches while the other one is in drill mode. Miner Bots will not mine emeralds, diamonds, or guilded blackstone. This is to prevent them from being dropped into lava.
