Hope you enjoy this!\nThe first new feature is a new mob, it?s the Pumpkin Knight! This skeleton wields a sword and will charge at you with it, the knight also won?t burn in the sun because of the pumpkin it is wearing! It?s attacks will inflict weakness onto you! They will drop their pumpkin and sometimes their sword if killed and you can find them spawning in flower and birch forest biomes.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5516/images/halloween-2020-addon_2.png"},{"text":"The next new mob is the Pumpkin Ghast!
