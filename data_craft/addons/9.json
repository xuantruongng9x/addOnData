You can use this video guide for the setup:\nWhen you are creating the game you can choose between different configs. Here is a quick overview:\nRush Config:\nFinal Heal at 10 minutes\nTurning PVP on at 20 minutes\nBorder 750 at 30 minutes\nBorder 500 at 35 minutes\nBorder 250 at 40 minutes\nBorder 100 at 45 minutes\nEndborder 50 at 50 minutes\nUHC 3.0 Config:\nHeal at 10 minutes\nFinal Heal at 20 minutes\nTurning PVP on at 20 minutes\nBorder 750 at 45 minutes\nBorder 500 at 50 minutes\nBorder 250 at 55 minutes\nBorder 100 at 60 minutes\nEndborder 50 at 65 minutes\nUHC 3.0 Config (One Heal):\nFinal Heal at 10 Minutes\nTurning PVP on at 20 minutes\nBorder 750 at 45 minutes\nBorder 500 at 50 minutes\nBorder 250 at 55 minutes\nBorder 100 at 60 minutes\nEndborder 50 at 65 minutes\nPardox Config:\nFinal Heal at 10 minutes\nTurning PVP on at 20 minutes\nBorder 750 at 40 minutes\nBorder 500 at 50 minutes\nBorder 250 at 55 minutes\nBorder 100 at 60 minutes\nEndborder 50 at 65 minutes\nAnd for the scenarios here is a list of all scenarios with a quick explanation:\nVanilla+: doubles the apple rate (default 5,5%) to 11%\nPeaceful: no mobs and no food necessary\nEnchantless: you can?t gain xp but each kill will give you 5 levels\nNoClean: you can?t get cleaned by anyone for 15 seconds after you killed someone\nNoFall: no fall damage\nCutClean: auto smelted ores\nFireless: no fire damage\nHasteyboys: all tools will get efficiency 3\nTimebomb: if someone dies a chest will be spawned with a head in it and the items on top of it. The chest is going to explode after 30 seconds\nDiamondless: you can?t mine diamonds but you will get two diamonds per kill\nBowless: bows can?t be crafted\nRodless: rods can?t be crafted\nShields: you can craft shields\nLimitations: you can just mine 64 iron, 32 gold and 16 diamonds\nBlooddiamonds: you will lose 1/2 heart if you break a diamond\nDoubleores: you will get 2 ores instaed of 1 (iron, gold and diamonds)\nAll players get scattered over the whole map (2000?2000). In team uhcs the team will be scattered together and vip players can set the approximate position for their team (coming later to this). Don?t forget that minecraft has some problems with the spreadplayers command, so it is recommended to use a map with no ocean.\nThe vip rank was implemented for the supporters of the project. As a hoster you can choose whoever the rank should get. Therefore you can look at this tutorial:\nAnd here you can see the advantages of the vip rank. For me it was important to not give people real ingame advantages like starter equip e. g.\nWith this item you can add 1 scenario to the uhc.\nBut don?t forget: only 2 VIPs can add a scenario!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5790/images/uhc-40-16-scenarios-and-more_2.png"},{"text":"With this glasses in your inventory, you can choose your scatterposition.

Acacia Stripped Logs cannot mix with Warped Hyphae or regular Acacia Logs). This is because I?m not doing the millions of variations for each placement. Secondly, since this is a behaviour pack, unfortunately you cannot get achievements in that world (unless some cheaty file editing is done to the world).
