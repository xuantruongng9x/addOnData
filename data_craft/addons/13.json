As you probably guessed, it spawns in snowy biomes. This slime is quite slow and has little health, but it?s attacks will inflict slowness on you so watch out! Killing it will reward you with some ice or an ice slimeball. Use the ice slimeball to make a Frozen Slime Block. It?s like the opposite of a honey block, it has incredibly high friction so you will run super fast while on it!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5156/images/slimes-addon_8.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5156/images/slimes-addon_9.png"},{"text":"Next up: the Pink Slime! This is a TINY slime, definitely the smallest one of the bunch. However, due to it?s high cellar density, it has over 100 health points! It?s also incredibly fast, but deals a very small amount of damage. This slime was actually inspired by the Pinky enemy from Terraria. Killing it gives you a Pink Slimeball, use 9 of them to make a sticky pink slime block!

As it?s name suggests, this slime is also peaceful and won?t ever attack you. In fact, you can ride on top of them! To control them, hold a regular stick and the friendly slime will go in whatever location you are pointing. Unlike horses, they can float on water while you are riding them and can climb blocks fairly easily! You?ll see friendly slimes in swamp biomes, and killing them will give you a saddle. But please don?t kill them, you monster.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5156/images/slimes-addon_12.png"},{"text":"On the topic of swamps, this mob right here is the Slimed Zombie! As you probably already noticed, it?s not a slime. But it is a zombie that?s covered in slime, so it?s close enough! Because they are covered in slime, it means they won?t burn in the sun and have some extra health! They will attack you and deal more damage then a normal zombie. If you kill one, you might get some rotten flesh or a slime block. They spawn in extreme hills, dark oak forests and swamps\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5156/images/slimes-addon_13.png"},{"text":"Here is a Honey Slime. This sticky slime will be found in jungle biomes! As it is very sticky and dense, it has quite a lot of health! Additionally, their attacks will inflict slowness onto you.

You can turn a honey slimeball into some extra honey!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5156/images/slimes-addon_14.png"},{"text":"The next new mob is the Mossy Slime! It?s?well? it?s a slime covered in moss. But it is quite dangerous! Their attacks do a fair amount of damage and will poison you for a bit. If you kill one, it drops a Mossy Slimeball. Mossy Slimeballs don?t have any use for now, but you can craft one with some vines and a slimeball! Mossy Slimes spawn in the jungle.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5156/images/slimes-addon_15.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5156/images/slimes-addon_16.png"},{"text":"Now up next is the Fiery Slime. They spawn commonly in the Nether. Please be careful around them, as they are very powerful for just a slime! Their attacks do quite a lot of damage and will inflict blindess on you. Of course, being a nether mob, they are immune to fire. Managing to kill one will reward you with a Fire Slimeball. The fire slimeball is non functional?for now?\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5156/images/slimes-addon_17.png"},{"text":"This is the Ender Slime! Ender Slimes are definitely a major threat you?ll need to watch out for while exploring the End. They can teleport, and their attacks do a LOT of damage and will weaken you. They drop an End Slimeball if killed, which does nothing as of right now.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5156/images/slimes-addon_18.png"},{"text":"Up next: the Void Slime. This slime actually doesn?t spawn anywhere for now, as I don?t quite know where it should spawn. They cannot move from the block they are spawned on, but they will attack you by shooting projectiles at you! Void Slimes currently do not drop anything but experience\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5156/images/slimes-addon_19.png"},{"text":"Now let?s look at the boss! The boss is known as the Colossal Slime. And it definitely shows, as this is one big slime! You could consider him the king of all slimes. The Colossal Slime has two methods of attack: the first one is just hoping towards you in an attempt to deal melee damage and the second one is to summon a bunch of slimes to attack you! It also frequently teleports around. Pro tip: the Colossal Slime hates water! If defeated, you will be rewarded with a ton of experience and a Royal Slimeball! The Royal Slimeball can be crafted into two powerful weapons, the Bane of Slimes and the Elemental Slime Bow. If you have these two weapons, it shows that you were powerful enough to take on the lord of the slimes and all his minions.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5156/images/slimes-addon_20.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/5156/images/slimes-addon_21.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/slimes-addon_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/addons/5156/Slimes-Addon.mcaddon"}],"uploadedBy":"An Epic gamer","uploadedAt":"13 Sep, 2020","supporteds":["1.16"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/slimes-plus-addon/"},{"title":"Plus Mobs Bedrock (Add-On)","briefDescription":"This is an addon add news 13 mobs , a new sword and a new apple.Plus Mobs Bedrock included animals, monsters and new villagers.You can ...","Description":"","crawledImageUrls":[{"text":"This is an addon add news 13 mobs , a new sword and a new apple.\nPlus Mobs Bedrock included animals, monsters and new villagers.\nYou can tame new wolfes, tiger and friendcreeper\nAll mobs Spawn natural in your minecraft world.\nAnd you can too craft new items.\nIf you want more mobs , this its your addon\nVideo\nit works in your Minecraft version 1.16 : Pe ?

Your days of safe daytime skies are about to end. And you?ll love it. Daytime flying fiends that will terrify and amaze. Well, mainly just terrify. But, let?s assume that?s what you?re here for.\nEverybody knows daytimes are a bit boring without any manner of aerial assault (at least in the overworld!) so we developed a ? solution.\nHawks are (most definitely) a hostile mob and the stars of this show. They spawn mostly in extreme hills, but you?ll see them every now and then in plains biomes and savanna plateaus. They definitely dislike players but they aren?t fond of pillagers either, so don?t feel too bad.\nThey *really* don?t like llamas, but in a good way! Because they won?t go near them. So, there?s a defense if you?re just starting out. Travel with llamas! Hope they don?t die along the way, because you might not like who will be next.\nThere are several variants of the larger birds. The lighter ones are much easier to handle, and are more common. The darker variants are truly nasty.\nWe?ve also added crows, most common in swamp biomes when the light level is reduced. They also spawn, less commonly, in daytime in taiga and plains biomes. Crows don?t care about llamas, unfortunately. They fear villagers though.\nLast, and least, we have seagulls. Ok, not least. Not really last either. Well, maybe least, we need a poll. They?re mostly neutral, but every now and then you?ll encounter a not-nice one. You know what to do. Spawns at the beach! Of course they do?.\nFor scaring crows!! And hawks, and seagulls, and (if you install Hurt Me Plenty and Pterodactyl addons) phantoms, blazes, ghasts and pterodactyls.\nFind them in swamps, chop them down, grab their spawn egg (looks like a scarecrow lollipop), and put it down where you don?t want hawks to attack.
