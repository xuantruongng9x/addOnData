It works in multiplayer; ? It has no extra unnecessary files ? Models and animations are interdependent, which means if you don?t like one of the models, you can go into the ?models? folder and delete it (and the textures in the ?texture? folder, if the has any textures); ? For animations, go into the ?animations? folder and delete the one you do not like.\nConversely, you can add your own models and animations, or integrate my models and animations into your own pack without breaking it, however, this is all theoretical and might possibly not work/break your pack (always make a backup before editing your packs).I take no responsibility for list files or anything.\nI also tried making the models so they work with custom textures (as long as the model is a default model), however, this means the pack textures are of lower quality, and also your custom textures might make the mob look weird (it?ll still work though!).\nSome models, such as the bee and firework, have a dedicated texture, so don?t support custom textures.\nAnd now for the models and animations;\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/texturepacks/3470/images/leafs-mobber-mobs_3.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/leafs-mobber-mobs_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/texturepacks/3470/Leafs-Mobber-Mobs.mcpack"}],"uploadedBy":"leafgolde","uploadedAt":"8 Oct, 2020","supporteds":["1.16","16x"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/leafs-mobber-mobs/"},{"title":"Classic Styled","briefDescription":"Most of the new blocks from 1.16 based on updated textures, this pack changes a few blocks to match the classic look of the game.

Here?s my question. Have you ever wanted to use those swords separately? Your answer is most likely no. However, I present to you my very own short swords texture pack. This is most likely the most simple one you will find on MCPE DL. And that?s exactly what makes it so great. It has no major changes to the sword?s design besides practically chopping the end off and rebuilding it. Other short sword packs rather do all this complicated stuff that isn?t actually that complicated by sharpening the edges or completely redesigning the handles and tips and all that.
