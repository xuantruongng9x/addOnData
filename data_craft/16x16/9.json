Basically I was bored and remembered that the old villagers are gone now we have the new Village And Pillage ones. This pack makes the new villagers look like the old ones, same with the Zombie Villagers.\nThis pack brings back the old zombie villagers and normal villagers, I also removed the biome thingies for the villagers so it looks more like the old ones. I also modernized the textures of them to match them with Jappas new textures!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/texturepacks/1480/images/pre-114-villagers_4.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/texturepacks/1480/images/pre-114-villagers_5.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/texturepacks/1480/images/pre-114-villagers_6.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/texturepacks/1480/images/pre-114-villagers_7.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/texturepacks/1480/images/pre-114-villagers_8.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/texturepacks/1480/images/pre-114-villagers_9.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/texturepacks/1480/images/pre-114-villagers_10.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pre-114-villagers_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/texturepacks/1480/pre_1_14_vil.mcpack"},{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/texturepacks/1480/Pre1.14Vil.zip"}],"uploadedBy":"Stephano7740","uploadedAt":"20 Mar, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.12","1.13","1.14","1.15 (beta)","1.16","16x"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/pre-1-14-villagers/"},{"title":"More Realistic Ores","briefDescription":"This adds 6 new retextures for every ore but nether quartz to match their real-life counter-part.
