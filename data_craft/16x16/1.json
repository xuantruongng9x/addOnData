It?s for the most part an exact conversion, and all non-moving things have been converted. Everything has had special care, and tweaking put into it! ?\nEVERYTHING THAT DOES NOT MOVE, has been converted from a simple vanilla to a very fancy, and flashy texture pack. Every block that should glow, glows. Everything that should be smooth and slippery, is smooth and slippery. This may seem like just an ordinary vanilla-to-RTX conversion, but this one has a twist! This pack has a few special, and fun glowing blocks! They can be used for testing, or they can be used for fun scenes. It?s up to you really. And to access those blocks, when creating a world you wanna activate the Education Edition setting. Those are what supply you with the Elemental blocks, which are transformed into the fun blocks with their own properties. So yes! This does mean that you no longer have to sacrifice concrete, terracotta, or clay in order to have the shiinyy liiights!! Therefore this pack is excellent for worlds that were normally vanilla, that you wanna add a very nice touch too! The extra blocks include may colors of lights, a warm and cold version of a white light, an EXTREMELY bright spot light block, a few disco and colorful tiles, along with a few fun materials like brushed Aluminum, and Copper! (By the way, for the blocks to work properly, make sure the texture pack is activated on that world, and not just as a global resource)\nMy Discord username is[ Kelly The Dragon!#9999 ]. If you have any questions/Suggestions, just friend me on there, and I?ll be more than happy to answer!
