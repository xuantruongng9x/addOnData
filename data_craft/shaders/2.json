That won?t happen again with this new texture pack, wich replaces water color from almost every biome and you can combine with any other texture pack.\nThis texture pack works for every resolution because it just changes water color, so ignore the resolution 16x, that was posted before, it is just the default resolution of the game.\nBasically it replaces most of the default biome default colors with others that are much more colorful and biome-exclusives to give the game a more striking and pleasant touch.\nAs I said earlier, it can be mixed with any other texture pack which doesn?t change de water color by itself, so don?t be afraid to do it!\nSome examples are the warm ocean variants, which now have a much lighter color, the jungle, with a deep greenish water, or the flower forest, that I hope you will discover by yourself.\nBiomes changed: Sunflower plains, desert, flower forest, taiga, swampland?, river, nether, end, beaches, ice plains, jungle, bamboo forest, roofed forest, savana and all types of oceans, specially warm, lukewarm and frozen. In theses examples it is used the texture pack Multipixel too, by @ZouChenyunfei, to demonstrate its compatibility.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/texturepacks/1573/images/improved-biome-water-colors_2.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/improved-biome-water-colors_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/texturepacks/1573/Biomes_water_color.mcpack"}],"uploadedBy":"IRDOR13","uploadedAt":"4 Apr, 2020","supporteds":["1.14","16x","Shaders"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/improved-biome-water-colors/"},{"title":"Functionality Shader","briefDescription":"This shader can display chunk border, redstone signal level in digital and binary way.
