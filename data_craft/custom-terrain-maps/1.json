The park is divided into two sections, Future World and World Showcase, with the former being about future technologies and the latter about the unique and diverse cultures of our planet. Step into one of eight pavilions in Future World where you?ll learn about what the future holds in different themes, ranging from communications to transportation, under the sea and in outer space, and into the farthest reaches of imagination, the possibilities are endless! Come and explore today!\nThis map has been my personal endeavor for almost 3 years. Ever since I discovered the past version of the theme park I love most, Epcot, as it looked in 1989 with all the original pavilions, I have always wanted to build my own version to enjoy and modify. Since starting this project in January 2018, I have slowly shaped a flat Minecraft world into the masterpiece you see today. Each pavilion was handcrafted with precision and care over the course of months to reflect their real-life counterparts, while displaying a Minecraft twist that lives up to a quality experience any guest would expect. Now, I want to share my hard work with the world, so everyone can experience the EPCOT Center of the past, and enjoy the promise of a bright future!\nThanks for checking out my map, and welcome to the
