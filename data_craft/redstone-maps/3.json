At the beginning of the world, there will be a brief tutorial on how to start / start the main engine, as well as Boreus? engine.\n1. Simple Motorcycle ? This simple motorcycle is fast, easy to make, and stylish!\nThis motorcycle is the smallest of the creations, and requires just 5 honey blocks to make. To start, break the obsidian, and replace it to stop.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/5346/images/diamoncs-5-slime-block-creations_3.png"},{"text":"2. Private Jet ? This fast airplane is great for flying in style, and seeing the world from a new perspective.\nAs with the other designs, it?s as simple as breaking the obsidian block!\n3. The Mantis Mech ? Although small, this mech is great for causing chaos, as is very hard to destruct. Trying to throw TNT at it? It will just fly right back at you! Destroyed it?s leg? It will keep on going.\nThis design is more complicated and is the first weaponized design on the list. With 2 minecarts, you can easily switch from the tail (to start), and the cockpit (to fire TNT and to brake.)\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/5346/images/diamoncs-5-slime-block-creations_4.png"},{"text":"4. Boreus ? This albeit, slow dragon is perfect for inspiring fear! With being able to hold 20,000+ items of cargo, or 30+ passengers, this dragon is incredibly useful. It is a bit slow to reduce lag for low-end devices.\nThis is the only design that uses a observer-powered engine, so it will be slower to reduce lag for low-end devices. To start, simple ?update? any observer, and place obsidian to stop it.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/5346/images/diamoncs-5-slime-block-creations_5.png"},{"text":"5. Boreus Prime ? This incredibly fast version of Boreus wreaks havoc wherever it flies! Piloted by Ghasts, this ship is well defended and has A double fire TNT canon, as well as a Ghast canon and 2 blaze canons. You don?t want to mess with Boreus Prime!\nBoreus prime uses a faster observerless engine like the first 3, so it may be laggy for low-end devices. It is mostly identical to Boreus prime but it has a Ghast canon and different looks.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/5346/images/diamoncs-5-slime-block-creations_6.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/diamoncs-5-slime-block-creations_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/5346/DiamonC_1587415484.mcworld"}],"uploadedBy":"Diamondc250","uploadedAt":"23 Apr, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.13","1.14","1.15 (beta)","1.16"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/diamoncs-5-slime-block-creations/"},{"title":"Block Party! ?

But that?s not the only purpose of this map, feel free to check the commands itself, it will maybe ensure your command block skills or maybe improve a little. You can also learn from this world if you want to make a map yourself. Just try not to change the command tho.\n\nOkay, so, this is what you will see if you enter the world. This map includes 10+ command block creations that maybe you could be interested to see.\nLike for example, this are creations that you will see in this world. The commamd itself might be buggy, because I made these things a long time ago. Feel free to test it yourself and report any bugs that you might see.\n\n? Custom arrows, or should I say, magic arrows. This arrow have its own special effect that are not in minecraft. This creation have the command such as ?execute? and ?detect?. Please note that this will only work if you hit the grass as it uses a detect command.\n\n? Infinity Gauntlet also known as Infinity Fishing Rod. This unique item acts like exactly a gauntlet in Avengers Endgame and Infinity War. I?m afraid to say that the only ability this can do is SNAP! Yeah, it?s pretty awesome right? But, don?t worry, I will try my best to add many abilities as I can, like how the Time Stone works(I?m currently working on it). So expect an update. The only ability you can do is a snap. This one is one of my favorite creations that I?ve made so far.\n\n? Color changing sign, well this one is rather simple or unique, it depends on you. You can use this as decoration for anything you are doing. But it?s cool right? You can also change it to animating. So feel free to use this.\n\n? Bedwars bed mechanics, this one is my third favorite so far. If you break the bed, there will be a message that will pop that you see exactly in hypixel bedwars. Pretty cool right? This will help you if you are making a bedwars map yourself.\n\n? Up/Down Animating Door, my second favorite, this door will act like it?s really opening. This also has a particle that added a lot of detail in this contraption, it acts like there is gas escaping in the door. This will help you if you making a laboratory doors. Feel free to check the commands.\n\n? Morph, ah, the last one that I included in the description. This creation is so cool, you can morph into a bat or a chicken, perfect for trolling your friends. But do you think that?s everything in the map? The answer is No. I only included few because I?m too lazy to make a description on all of the creations, this will take a long time.\n","imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/zhaoxs-awesome-commandblock-world_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/5202/Zhaoxs-Awesome-CB-World_1587058589.mcworld"},{"href":"https://www.mediafire.com/download/m4z3m0vzj9ju639"}],"uploadedBy":"Zhaox","uploadedAt":"16 Apr, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.15 (beta)"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/zhaoxs-awesome-commandblock-world/"},{"title":"DeathRunAdventure","briefDescription":"Welcome to DeathRunAdventure!
