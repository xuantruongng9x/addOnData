It is a team building, point progression game, The more you are on the point, the more points you get. 100 points to win. And if both teams are on the point, no one gets points until there is only 1 team left on the point! I recommend playing 2v2 or 3v3 (no more) but 1v1 if you have to.\nYou start by pressing the start button, then choosing a character, taking your items. THen you will realise that you will have abilities or barriers in your inventory, these can be dropped when fully charged to unleash a full on ability.
