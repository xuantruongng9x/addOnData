So if you?re looking for a little uncommon minigame of its own concept, this is for you!\nBreaker VS Runner is a map with 2 roles: Breaker and Runner. The Breaker?s goal is to make the runner fall, whether it?s by punching them into surrounding lava or breaking the bedrock near the Runner. You may hit the Runner off, or you may break the blocks beneath their feet. The fun part about being the Breaker? You get to be invisible! So not only are you attempting to kill all Runners, you get to troll them in almost every way you can imagine! I admit, it?s kind of like The Floor Is Lava, but it?s still pretty fun with the stopwatch and the effects!\nThe Runner?s role is self-explanatory, but to sum it up, you pretty much just avoid death. Not enough description for you? Well, the Runner gets Speed and Jump Boost 10 to help them! Be careful, though. They can be both a blessing and a curse. There is also a stopwatch in seconds (Your XP bar) for each individual Runner so that you can compare times alive as well! See who?s better at surviving!\nOnce you die as a Runner, you get sent to the spectating area! You can spectate the rest of the match and watch your other friends struggle to avoid falling off, maybe even see them do some cool tricks or see hilarious deaths! Almost anything goes!\nBored with the map? Well, grab some more friends! This map will support as many players as Minecraft allows! Want a small twist? Have multiple Breakers and less Runners! It makes for good fun. ? Also, please note that sadly, yes, breakers are actually able to break the map, so please don?t do it! It ruins the game for everyone. There?s nothing to see outside of the map. Also, please note that I use a texture pack, so you may not get the exact same results as I did when taking screenshots.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7565/images/breaker-vs-runner--major-update-d_2.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7565/images/breaker-vs-runner--major-update-d_3.png"},{"text":"Arena\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7565/images/breaker-vs-runner--major-update-d_4.png"},{"text":"Bottom of the map\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7565/images/breaker-vs-runner--major-update-d_5.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/breaker-vs-runner-major-update-d_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/7565/aBreaker-eVS-bRunner_1601058821_1601156687.mcworld"}],"uploadedBy":"EatNYeet","uploadedAt":"27 Jul, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.16"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/breaker-vs-runner-map/"},{"title":"ONE IN THE CHAMBER","briefDescription":"One in the Chamber in a classic game best known from Call of Duty and other shooter games.

You only have one chance with it.\nIf you feel like you?re going to die, throw yourself into the void rather than giving your opponent free stuff.\nFor the defense:\nProtect your pool by surrounding it with blocks, by solidifying its roof ? Make it difficult to access by laying slabs underneath, by removing the stairs that lead to it ?\nIf you get to the middle first, try to protect the latter as much as possible with blocks (preferably wood), to delay the opposing team.\nIn order to prevent theft in your safe room as much as possible, break the glass and completely isolate the room with blocks: only one entry / exit!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/8552/images/thetower_3.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thetower_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/8552/1The7To4wer_1598859740.mcworld"},{"href":"https://www.clipeee.com/creator/dragonnoirfrytb"}],"uploadedBy":"DragonNoirFRYtB","uploadedAt":"1 Sep, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.10","1.11","1.12","1.13","1.14","1.15 (beta)","1.16","1.6","1.7","1.8","1.9"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/thetower-map/"},{"title":"Range Battle 1.0 (Team Deathmatch Minigame)","briefDescription":"Are you bored with previous minigames?
