In this minigame, players have to fight each other with swords and kill each other until one player is remaining. It also has a lot of cool and unique ways to get around the map, and some Game modes!\nNormal Game mode:\nSword Battle Wars is a PvP Last man standing minigame with wooden swords. To kill someone, you must knock them of the edge into the floor (more specifically, y coordinate 4) or kill them with your sword. Every couple of seconds you get a random chance of getting a random enchantment (unbreaking, knockback, sharpness, and fire aspect) which will help you kill your opponents, you also have a random chance to get speed for 3 seconds which can help you either escape someone or get closer to someone.\nCreepy Crawlers Game mode (Halloween Themed):\nIn Creepy Crawlers, spiders spawn almost everywhere around the city, your goal is to be the last player standing and fend of the spiders with stone swords and random enchantments (unbreaking, knockback, bane of arthropods or fire aspect). PvP is also turned off in this game, this means that you can team up with your friends to Conquer the spiders, but one by, everyone will die shortly after. Only one player can win in this mode, so make sure you?re the one who doesn?t get bitten to death, or fall from the Buildings!\n(Spiders also get Speed, Strength, and resistance. Which makes them have more health, makes them stronger, and also makes them faster. Also this game mode is NOT recommended for low end devices.)\nMini-Game modes:\nMini-Game modes are settings you can activate and will be added for any game mode. For example? If you want to activate elytra for any game mode, then go ahead!\nTrailer for sword battle wars coming to my YouTube channel sometime in the future.\nI am the ORIGINAL creator of this world.\nSettings:\nIn the settings, you can change where the wins appear, camera shake, time of day, etc. to your preference!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/8914/images/sword-battle-wars_3.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/8914/images/sword-battle-wars_4.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/8914/images/sword-battle-wars_5.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/8914/images/sword-battle-wars_6.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/8914/images/sword-battle-wars_8.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sword-battle-wars_1-1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/8914/SwordBattleWarsv1.0.4.zip"},{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/8914/SwordBattleWarsv1.0.2"},{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/8914/SwordBattleWarsv1.0.3"},{"href":"https://www.mediafire.com/file/lzsd97vdd1lmobd/SwordBattleWars%255Bv1.0.5%255D%255B1%255D.zip/file"},{"href":"http://www.mediafire.com/file/bx7m607uksdq6ua/SwordBattleWars%257Bv1.0.6%255D.zip/file"}],"uploadedBy":"ItsxX250VIPXx","uploadedAt":"25 Sep, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.16"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/sword-battle-wars/"},{"title":"The KingKaden 1V1 Map (High Frames) (Very Pog)","briefDescription":"The KingKaden 1V1 Map is a Minecraft Bedrock Edition 1V1 map focused on a smooth experience that\u0027s easy to use, yet highly configurable.
