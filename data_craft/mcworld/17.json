Well, this map is sure to please all those looking for a difficult challenge! With 3 levels of enormous tower parkour, D3MD0GG0S? Tower Parkour is one of the best out there!\nThe map has a slightly complex design, built to annoy the player with difficult jumps. There are three rings, each with different obstacles.\nThe Outer ring is where you start. Climbing the walls, slowly but surely, to the very top will allow you passage into the Second ring. Make sure to take this one slowly, as the smallest mistake can lead to minutes? worth of parkour lost.\nThe Second ring, a labyrinth of passageways, has a different goal: to reach the bottom. The glass floors and tight corners will prove to be difficult, so watch your step! Once you descend the tower, you will find yourself in the third and final Center ring.\nIn the Center ring, you will again make your way towards the top. Ladders and ceiling jumps will be your main obstacles here. Once you reach the Checkpoint Plate, you will be transported to the Homestretch.\nThe short Homestretch is a slow climb up to the Pinnacle, but once you complete it, you?re nearly there! The Pinnacle consists only of a staircase to victory!\nIn the newest update a Practice Course was added to train on!
