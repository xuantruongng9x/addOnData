Because you will be riding a Strider the whole fight! If you try to get off your strider, you will be transformed into a burnt steak by the lava below you!\nShort Information about the map:\nThis is a 2-player map. Although you can still play this map with 3 or more players, but it will be too crowded since the battle arena is very small, designed only for 1 VS 1 PvP game.\nEach player will receive a stone sword, and a bow with 5 arrows, protected by a full set of iron armor. Each player will fight to their death while riding a Strider the whole game! Note that the Striders are immortal, and cannot be controlled, so you have to navigate and move from one Strider to another, so you can dodge your opponent?s attacks!
