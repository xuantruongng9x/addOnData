There is also one hidden music disc for every game, and if you manage to find them all? well? something special will happen.\nCurrent Mini-games:\nParkour Paradise: Over 3 hours of parkour! Trust me I sat through it, well actually I was sprinting,,, Includes a spawn lobby that branches out into different levels\nCeiling Fan Skyblock: Generator based Skyblock that includes public mines, plots, islands, shops, and multiple worlds to explore.\nThe Labyrinth: A gigantic maze inside a? couch? Contains four endings and a potion shop to unlock new areas.\nBoat Racing: 2 race tracks, one looped and one finite, to try out! Includes auto boat reset system.\nJungle Hyjinx: Jungle Hyjinx is a survival mini-game set in, well a jungle duh.\nNether Factions: This is coming soon, but it will be free roaming of the entire nether.\nEvery game also has it?s own secrets and ways to earn emeralds. Spend emeralds on lottery tickets, crates or the shops.\nThere are currently four rooms to explore with more on the way, you just have to find them.\nThere will also be a Christmas Update on December 12th that is mostly for the realm.\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/msWSVeCSsY\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10380/images/home-sweet-home_4.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10380/images/home-sweet-home_3.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/home-sweet-home_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/10380/CgHUX3CAgA.mcworld"}],"uploadedBy":"Shadowy Fox","uploadedAt":"10 Dec, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.16","1.16.100","1.16.101","1.16.200"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/home-sweet-home-map-1/"},{"title":"The KingKaden 1V1 Map (High Frames) (Very Pog)","briefDescription":"The KingKaden 1V1 Map is a Minecraft Bedrock Edition 1V1 map focused on a smooth experience that\u0027s easy to use, yet highly configurable.
