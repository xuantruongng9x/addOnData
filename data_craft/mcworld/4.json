If they runout of oxygen during their shift, they will be dazed and lose consciousness, hence, they will sufferfrom blindness, which hinders them from performing their jobs effectively.\nBefore you run out of oxygen, you can use the old oxygen pump in the office which pumps 5 units of oxygen per pump with a 2 second delay.\nHowever, once you run out of oxygen, the hydraulics of the oxygen pump will lack oxygen to function properly, and thus, it will be rendered unusable\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_4.png"},{"text":"Along with those, the night guards also have a vent tracker which monitors the estimated locations of the Animatronics.

Anything that attempts to run into the office only to find a closed door would be stun locked and sent back to the stage\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_8.png"},{"text":"This also allows for exchange of air, but this time across a shorter distance. This also means a shorter distance for animatronics. However this one is smaller than an air vent, which means they will have to crawl through it, it takes them exactly 7.5 seconds (150 in-game) to crawl through.\nThis journey can be interrupted however using a button activated trapdoor. If there is an animatronic that just-so-happens to be crawling there, it will be stun locked and sent back to the stage.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_9.png"},{"text":"Should you fail to reach the office, you will be stun locked on an enclosed stage for a period of time before you are allowed to move around again. But no camping, that is overpowered and can ruin the game for your friends.

You can select whether there will be 1 or 2 night guards in the lobby.\nThe game will choose the closest person to the start button to be the night guard\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_11.png"},{"text":"The recommended pax is:\nWhen the game starts, the night guard will be sent to the office where they can collect their vent tracker from the box on the desk. Before the night guard officially start the game, he/she will be able to prepare and get familiar with the office.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_12.png"},{"text":"On the other hand, the Animatronics will be sent to the stage with closed curtains to wait for the night guard to officially start the shift\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_13.png"},{"text":"When the night guard is done inspecting the office, they can officially start the shift by pressing the button behind them, which will cause the vent tracker to reset and enable the night guard to control the doors, vents, air duct and oxygen pump.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_14.png"},{"text":"When the shift starts, the Animatronics will be released to the main stage where they can plot their attacks on the night guard.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_15.png"},{"text":"As soon as the game starts, the time will start ticking, the power and oxygen will start decreasing.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_16.png"},{"text":"The night guard will then have to survive from 12am to 6am (360s/6min) and conserve the limited power they have and keep their oxygen levels up.\nThe Oxygen will decrease by 1 unit every second, if the night guard runs out of oxygen, they will be blinded due to their gradually decreasing consciousness. This would hinder their ability to defend from door attacks and air duct attacks as it would be harder to see the Animatronic\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_17.png"},{"text":"Before oxygen runs out, oxygen can be pumped with the old oxygen pump in the office which pumps 5 units of oxygen per pump (button click) with a 2 second delay.\nHowever, once you run out of oxygen, the hydraulics of the oxygen pump will lack oxygen to function properly, and thus, it will be rendered unusable\nThe Power Usage are as follow:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_18.png"},{"text":"One way in which the Animatronics can attack the night guard are the vents, but, the Animatronics can be tracked by the guards in there via the vent tracker and the Animatronics are slower in the vents but they can sprint jump\nThe locations of the vent exits and entrances are as follows:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_19.png"},{"text":"The night guard can defend themselves using the vent tracker and shutting the appropriate vent seal.\nOn the vent tracker, the Animatronics are displayed as orange squares and red on a vent seal indicates that the vent seal is inactive/open while green indicates that the vent seal is active/closed.\nIn the example above, the Animatronic (indicated by the Orange square) is at Vent Seal 3, almost going to the office. And therefore, I activated Vent Seal 3 to shut the seal and send the Animatronic back to the Stage for a cooldown (15s if there is 2 guards, 20s if there is 1 guard).\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_20.png"},{"text":"When the vent seal is active, if the Animatronic is within a 2 block range behind the seal, they will get sent back to the stage for a cooldown. Because of the limited range, the night guard has to time the closing of the seal and the players playing as an Animatronic is discouraged to camp 3 blocks before the seal as it is unfair for the guard.\nHowever, there is an exception in Vent Seal 1, the diagram of Vent Seal 1 is as shown below.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_21.png"},{"text":"In Vent Seal 1, instead of the Animatronic being sent back if they are 2 blocks behind the Vent Seal, they will also be sent back if they are 4 blocks in front of the seal. This is done to ensure fairness. The Safe Area will be indicated by a sign as shown in the diagram. This change was made in order to discourage Animatronics camping on the ladder and make it more fair to the guard by creating a broader window of time for them to react.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_22.png"},{"text":"The 2nd way at which the Animatronics can attack the guard is through the 2 doors which are connected by hallways which are located at the following areas:\nThe hallways may be long and tedious for the Animatronics but the guards won?t be able to track Animatronics in the hallway and they have to actually check the door hallways to check for any Animatronics.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_23.png"},{"text":"Once the Animatronics have made it through the long hallways, they will see the doors of the office and they will need to make the final sprint into the guard?s office to win.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_24.png"},{"text":"For the night guards to defend against door attacks, they will have to occassionally check for Animatronics in the doorway. If there is an Animatronic there, they will have to flick the lever to close the door.\nOnce the door is closed, any Animatronics that can be seen in the doorway will be sent back to the stage for a cooldown. For a better game experience, the players playing as Animatronics shouldn?t camp at the side of the doorway to prevent getting caught.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_25.png"},{"text":"The last way in which the Animatronic can attack the guard is through the Air Duct which is in the Parts \u0026 Services room which is accessible backstage. Though the Air Duct is the quickest way to attack the guard, Animatronics can be easily spotted there and sent back as the Air Duct requires no power to be shut and it is right at the desk of the guard office.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_26.png"},{"text":"To crawl through the Air Duct and attack the night guard, the Animatronic will have to click the button at the Air Duct. The Animatronics will then crawl 1 block in the air duct per 1.5 seconds and it will take them a total of 7.5 seconds to crawl into the guard office and win.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_27.png"},{"text":"The guard will have to periodically check the Air Duct for any Animatronics and click the button on top to shut the Air Duct which will send back any Animatronics that is crawling in the Air Duct back to the stage for a cooldown.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10136/images/nightwatch-eps_28.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nightwatch-eps_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/10136/Nightwatch-EPS_1606145369.mcworld"},{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/10136/Nightwatch-EPS_1606145369.zip"}],"uploadedBy":"FYRE","uploadedAt":"26 Nov, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.16"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/nightwatch-eps/"},{"title":"Capture The Flag","briefDescription":"The simple game of Capture The Flag, This version is super simple and the basic of the basics, Feel free to edit the map and ...","Description":"","crawledImageUrls":[{"text":"The simple game of Capture The Flag, This version is super simple and the basic of the basics, Feel free to edit the map and loot table to your liking BUT make sure you don?t move the flags because the commands are set to their coordinates, So avoid moving them.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10170/images/capture-the-flag_3.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/capture-the-flag_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/10170/9Capture-7The-cFlag_1606290953.mcworld"}],"uploadedBy":"LUN5HTIME","uploadedAt":"26 Nov, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.16"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/capture-the-flag-map/"},{"title":"Fire and Ice Alpha","briefDescription":"A world that has a couple of heat or cold themed minigames on it, like spleef (snow) and SKOG.

However, anybody could cross the wall, so it is advised you play with friends that won?t muck around and grief things.\nI am planning on making updated versions of this, but I need game ideas.

You will be given a background story in the chat, and then after 30 seconds, waves of blazes will start spawning. There is a set amount of time between waves, that may vary from 15 seconds to 45 seconds. If you die, you cannot get back in, but you can spectate from a bird?s eye view. (Beware that it WILL summon the next wave on time regardless if you finished the previous wave or not. Also be aware that I may have some problems, because I don?t know how to finish the game when all players or monsters are dead. I may put a timer on the game, where you lose if you don?t kill the monsters in a certain amount of time. Regardless, I will figure things out.)\n!Warning: This is not grief proof. You can also farm for resources. Please don?t do that. Your best asset will be kicking or banning. There are multiple flaws which will only get solved until I get the ability to use commands to make blocks in a certain area breakable, and allow NPCs to be tapped so they can scan inventories.
