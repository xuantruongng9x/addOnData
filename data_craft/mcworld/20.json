At start I made some caves and others, so you can see how will your textures look in terrain. Next you have house, and at the end, a lot of blocks!\nIf you want to test your textures, because you don?t know, how they look, you can see a lot of blocks on this map! Maybe it don?t have all blocks, but i choose blocks that are most recently used! I tried to include a lot of blocks, because i wanted to have map with blocks, that can change in texture pack! I think this map is not very good, but still, you can test your texture pack in it! I tried do have map unique look, because i want to every map have something different! This map don?t have particles and mobs,because i don?t know how to make mobs don?t walk D:. But still, i hope you will enjoy map!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7483/images/texture-pack-review-map-_2.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7483/images/texture-pack-review-map-_3.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7483/images/texture-pack-review-map-_4.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7483/images/texture-pack-review-map-_5.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7483/images/texture-pack-review-map-_6.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7483/images/texture-pack-review-map-_7.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7483/images/texture-pack-review-map-_8.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/texture-pack-review-map-_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/7483/Texture-Pack-Review-Map.mcworld"}],"uploadedBy":"D4niel06","uploadedAt":"18 Jul, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.16"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/texture-pack-review-map-3/"},{"title":"Tower Of Nether","briefDescription":"You try to make it to the top but when you fall, you will start all over.
