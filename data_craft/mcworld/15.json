On the central tower is at its top a beacon to bring back and put at home while, on the opposite towers spawn iron ingots and lapis lazuli: practical for your armor and your enchantments! The endless battle for control of the ?mid? can begin\nPresentation: The Towers is a map created by DragonNoirFRYtB whose concept is quite simple: your objective will be to enter the opposing camp and score points by breaking the glass block and throwing yourself into a kind of pool located in the heart of the enemy base. The first team to score 3 points wins the game!\nYou can use crafts.\nYou can place and destroy as many blocks as you want.\nYou can loot enemy chests, but not destroy them.\nYou will find minecarts at TNT, you are prohibited from destroying opposing chests with them.\nOur little tips:\nAccording to the author, the map is made for teams of 3 to 5 players.\nIron armor will be very useful for offense as well as defense: think about it!\nFor the attack:\nQuick attacks on their own as bait can occupy a few opponents while other teammates pass.\nKamikaze attacks will only be effective if you take something away from the opposing team: eat their apples, drink their potions, loot their chests ?\nOnly take the important stuff when you think it is necessary! You only have one chance with it.\nIf you feel like you?re going to die, throw yourself into the void rather than giving your opponent free stuff.\nFor the defense:\nProtect your pool by surrounding it with blocks, by solidifying its roof ? Make it difficult to access by laying slabs underneath, by removing the stairs that lead to it ?\nIf you get to the middle first, try to protect the latter as much as possible with blocks (preferably wood), to delay the opposing team.\nIn order to prevent theft in your safe room as much as possible, break the glass and completely isolate the room with blocks: only one entry / exit!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/8552/images/thetower_3.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thetower_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/8552/1The7To4wer_1598859740.mcworld"},{"href":"https://www.clipeee.com/creator/dragonnoirfrytb"}],"uploadedBy":"DragonNoirFRYtB","uploadedAt":"1 Sep, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.10","1.11","1.12","1.13","1.14","1.15 (beta)","1.16","1.6","1.7","1.8","1.9"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/thetower-map/"},{"title":"Space Escape UPDATE!","briefDescription":"Space Escape is a short adventure map when you get kidnapped by Aliens and You need to escape quickly before you being a test experiment....","Description":"","crawledImageUrls":[{"text":"Space Escape is a short adventure map when you get kidnapped by Aliens and You need to escape quickly before you being a test experiment.\nFind keys, Fight Aliens and Escape the Alien Spaceship!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/8560/images/space-escape_2.png"},{"text":"Thanks for downloading!\nThis is my first map!

One of them is speed potions system. You can buy them in the hub and at every checkpoint now. (However, checkpoint ones cost 2 emeralds.) The work is now smelting iron, make 2 iron blocks to get 1 emerald.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/5145/images/rgby-parkour-3_3.png"},{"text":"The lava floor is gone.

Press the button to buy.\nYou will also notice the ?map lock? I mentioned in RGBY Parkour 2 is gone, this is because access to information is a human right. It is always a good idea to complete previous maps, however.\nThere is also a fixed number of three checkpoints in each level, balancing its difficulty. They are now 5?3 platforms, so no more ?Checkpoint reached!? messages annoying you.\nAfter you finish the main parkour, you will have the opportunity to try out the Extra Stage, which is extremely difficult and filled with novel gimmick jumps, and the whole level is designed as a good end to the map series, as you can tell from a variety of things, such as checkpoint design and block palette. Speed potions are not sold in this level, and you can complete it without using them.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/5145/images/rgby-parkour-3_5.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rgby-parkour-3_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/5145/rgby_parkour_3_new_1598513409.mcworld"}],"uploadedBy":"Sleepyhead101","uploadedAt":"13 Apr, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.12","1.13","1.14","1.16"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/rgby-parkour-3/"}]
