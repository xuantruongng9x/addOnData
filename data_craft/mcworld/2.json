There are 6 secrets around the map for you to find. Try to find them all. Good luck and have fun.\nThis is spleef meant to be fun. Don?t know what Spleef is? It?s a minigame where you get a shovel and try to break the snow underneath the enemy and make them fall into lava.\nYou can play with friends. You get a netherite shovel when ready to play. Simple commands too. There is a mini lobby for you while you wait for your friends. There are 10 max players however, you can change that with /setmaxplayers. Make sure you play fair. There are also 3 dimensions to choose from. The end, the nether, and the overworld. There are 3 layers to choose from for each dimension. Sounds simple right? It?s made by I?m Worthless329 and Echo7174. Try to find secrets throughout the map. There are 6 to be found. You can challenge your friends to a game of spleef. This took me a week to make. I hope you enjoy. The layers reset so you dont need to worry. Here are some screenshots.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10538/images/simple-spleef_3.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10538/images/simple-spleef_2.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/simple-spleef_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/10538/SimpleSpleef_1608259374.mcworld"}],"uploadedBy":"Jonathan The Turtle","uploadedAt":"20 Dec, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.16","1.16.100","1.16.101","1.16.200"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/simple-spleef-map/"},{"title":"[OP] Simple Survival World!","briefDescription":"Well today its a very OVERPOWERED simple survival world!!
