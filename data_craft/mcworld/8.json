The park is divided into two sections, Future World and World Showcase, with the former being about future technologies and the latter about the unique and diverse cultures of our planet. Step into one of eight pavilions in Future World where you?ll learn about what the future holds in different themes, ranging from communications to transportation, under the sea and in outer space, and into the farthest reaches of imagination, the possibilities are endless! Come and explore today!\nThis map has been my personal endeavor for almost 3 years. Ever since I discovered the past version of the theme park I love most, Epcot, as it looked in 1989 with all the original pavilions, I have always wanted to build my own version to enjoy and modify. Since starting this project in January 2018, I have slowly shaped a flat Minecraft world into the masterpiece you see today. Each pavilion was handcrafted with precision and care over the course of months to reflect their real-life counterparts, while displaying a Minecraft twist that lives up to a quality experience any guest would expect. Now, I want to share my hard work with the world, so everyone can experience the EPCOT Center of the past, and enjoy the promise of a bright future!\nThanks for checking out my map, and welcome to the 21st century!\nBe Sure to follow my social media!\nInstagram: Mickeynerd17_Productions\nYouTube: Mickeynerd17_Productions\nMap (parking lot):\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/c9c6be022b15628265b590a75f74fa0c.png"},{"text":"Map (Main Park):\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/7ebc45d6bd56d21e9892d4c576e9386b.png"},{"text":"Transportation and Ticket Center (Spawn):\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/ee0f28c2a354103d6d543cd2a8f48969.png"},{"text":"Parking Lots B and D, and parking tram station:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/8ecfd02df0c934000ec568dbe93eb220.png"},{"text":"Parking Lots A and C, Epcot Monorail Station, and main entrance:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/8ca53eb23eb655a02b61dbede740bc1c.png"},{"text":"Bus Loop:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/c59d0ccaf916fb97381e30560c5b79ad.png"},{"text":"Photos of the pavilions:\nFUTURE WORLD:\nSpaceship Earth\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/5580529aeeef8c65d7308a641035010a.png"},{"text":"Universe of Energy\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/b849a0147914e731642d155b5dad18d2.png"},{"text":"Wonders of Life (NEW!)\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/cd1fea879215c4b501f8e2e1ebb4d488.png"},{"text":"Horizons\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/882911ebc9242ef0f82a8fe1f343cdf4.png"},{"text":"World of Motion\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/d1a75f9dd58eebc09f5fa015f6e4150f.png"},{"text":"Communicore\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/e19f45e064195c17259113b850674759.png"},{"text":"Journey into Imagination\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/d1ef94e2a19f53df71ed28cdc6b71ca3.png"},{"text":"The Land\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/disneys-epcotcenter_16.png"},{"text":"The Living Seas\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/disneys-epcotcenter_17.png"},{"text":"The Odyssey Restaurant\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/disneys-epcotcenter_18.png"},{"text":"WORLD SHOWCASE:\nMexico\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/disneys-epcotcenter_19.png"},{"text":"Canada\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/disneys-epcotcenter_20.png"},{"text":"Norway\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/486/images/disneys-epcotcenter_21.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disneys-epcotcenter_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/486/EPCOT_Center_V10_1603818413.mcworld"},{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/486/EPCOT_Center_V9_1593327127.mcworld"}],"uploadedBy":"mickeynerd17","uploadedAt":"10 Feb, 2019 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.16","1.16.100"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/epcot-center-v1/"},{"title":"Some Strange Village","briefDescription":"My first attempt at making a map, welcome to my little village/survival map; Some Strange Village!

You can smelt any item you wish in mass production or mass produce a selection of different items. All of these outputs (smelted items) will be categorised and sorted beneath the machine itself. Every item that you can possibly smelt has two huge storage units for itself. A few more units for items such as gold, diamond, redstone, iron etc so the storage unit wont overflow with your most smelted items! All of the storage units are directly accessible from the outside of the machine, for instant access. There is a platform that has the top furnaces input loaders.\nThese are the barrels, which all you have to do is fill it up, pull the lever and watch the items fly up the tube and into the machine! The bottom furnaces all have the same sort of system, its just built inside the machine itself, almost factory like. Also on the platform is one single button, to add a TON of fuel to the machine and keep it powering on! This can be done manually via the button is mentioned, or can be activated with a lever to make the sweeper go back and fourth at timed intervals! It has 45 loaders for the fuel system, which all have their own light to indicate whether it is unloading fuel into the machine or not. There is also two levers. One for the top furnaces to power them on, and one for the bottom furnaces to power them on. Each floor has 10 furnace systems, altogether 20!\nI hope you enjoy this build, and any recommendations/suggestions would be appreciated.\nAculos.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/9513/images/bedrock-multi-use-ultimate-super-smelter_2.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bedrock-multi-use-ultimate-super-smelter_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/9513/Bedrock-Ultimate-Super-Smelter_1603278487.mcworld"}],"uploadedBy":"Aculos","uploadedAt":"22 Oct, 2020","supporteds":["1.11","1.12","1.13","1.14","1.16"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/bedrock-multi-use-ultimate-super-smelter/"},{"title":"Find the Button: Apocalypse Edition","briefDescription":"Welcome to my second Find the Button map.
