There will be more boxes like a biome explorer box and a trading hall box.\nYou will spawn with the saturation effect. This will make it so if you fall and take damage, you don?t have to eat in order to get more health.\nSome Nether boxes have lava and all end boxes have a void. If you die at levels 1-10, you will re spawn at level 1. If you die at level 11-30 you will re spawn at level 11 so be careful.\nThere are three levels where you need a bow. When you get to level 14 ?get the skulls? you will get a bow and arrow.
