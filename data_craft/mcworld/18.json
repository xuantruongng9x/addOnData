First, you select a class you would like to play as, and the game is ready to be played.\nOnce you have selected your class, you can start the game and everyone will teleport into the structure, where lava will begin to pour onto it.\nThe objective is to survive the longest and be the last one surviving.\nInside the structure will be hidden loot and areas to hide in.\nThe map can also rest, so you can play as many rounds as you like! (However the more resets, the more lag)\nAre there any rules?\nNot exactly!

This map is a deeply edited map which was made by ThirdPE (Original map: Block Clutch Practice)\nMAP MAY BE CONFUSING, PRESS BLUE BUTTONS FOR TUTORIAL\nWatch tutorial video at the bottom if still unclear\nProof of permission: Reply from Bob bib?s comment in this YouTube link\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7779/images/hard-block-clutch--pvp-practice-world_16.png"},{"text":"This map?s focus is to help you improve in games like SkyWars, BedWars, CTF etc? by mostly focusing on the block clutch aspect of these games. Throughout this map you will have to block clutch in exact areas with the max being a double block clutch. Furthermore, this map helps you improve your bowing \u0026 PvP combo accuracy in 2 main challenges.\nThere are 8 main challenges in this world that consist of:\n? 4 Block clutch sections\n? 1 Bow accuracy section\n? 1 PvP combo section\n? 1 Ender Pearl, practice section\n? 1 PvP on bridge practice section\nBlock clutching: (Green blocks mean you have to double block clutch)\n? While Jumping mid air, place a block on the side of the indicated blocks (onto the Cobblestone or green concrete) to catch yourself\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7779/images/hard-block-clutch--pvp-practice-world_10.png"},{"text":"Bow Aiming by shooting towards a constantly moving enderman\n? When jumping onto a pressure plate after water clutching you will be teleported to this section\n? The enderman will constantly move due to it raining and you will have to constantly readjust where you are aiming your bow to get a good shot.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7779/images/hard-block-clutch--pvp-practice-world_11.png"},{"text":"Pvp practice by keeping a skeleton in the air (you have to not let it touch the ground while trying to dodge it?s arrows)\n? You will have speed, the skeleton will have feather falling. Your goal is to practice your combos by keeping it in the air (using your punches) while dodging its arrows. If it hits the ground hold out the fishing rod (9th slot) to effect the skeleton with levitation for 2 seconds. Only use the fishing rod if it?s about to hit the ground.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7779/images/hard-block-clutch--pvp-practice-world_4.png"},{"text":"Ender pearl practice\n? You simply throw an ender Pearl to where the blue arrow is pointing (you spawn on the right platform \u0026 throw the ender Pearl onto the left platform)\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7779/images/hard-block-clutch--pvp-practice-world_15.png"},{"text":"Block clutching on the sides of blocks\n?

This is good practice for BedWars, the bridge, skywars etc? because it simulates two opponents needing to knock the other off the bridge, using yourself \u0026 a vindicator. Your goal is to punch the vindicator off the bridge without falling off yourself\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7779/images/hard-block-clutch--pvp-practice-world_7.png"},{"text":"Practice block clutching when moving at sonic speeds\n? This section is good practice for BedWars \u0026 skywars because you will be effected with speed \u0026 jump boost which simulates being punched off of an island, or tnt jumping, and having to block clutch onto another island.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7779/images/hard-block-clutch--pvp-practice-world_8.png"},{"text":"Finally, practice doing block clutches while being hit by arrows constantly\n? In minigames like skywars \u0026 BedWars being knocked off a bridge by bows or throwable items happen often, \u0026 this section helps your simulate these experiences by forcing you to block clutch \u0026 keep yourself on the bridge\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7779/images/hard-block-clutch--pvp-practice-world_14.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hard-block-clutch-pvp-practice-world_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/7779/BlockClutch.mcworld"},{"href":"https://www.mediafire.com/file/pj6pv3o179lluoy/BlockClutch.mcworld.zip/file"}],"uploadedBy":"Mr Bib Bob","uploadedAt":"4 Aug, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.16","1.6","1.7","1.8","1.9"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/hard-block-clutch-pvp-practice-world/"},{"title":"MikRock09?s Destiny Map","briefDescription":"What\u0027s your destiny?
