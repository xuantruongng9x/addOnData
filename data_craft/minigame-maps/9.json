I have that?s why I made mining Simulator into Minecraft. Mining simulator is simulator game where you have to mine ores to progress.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/4232/images/mining-simulator_2.jpeg"},{"text":"The objective of this game is to mine ores and sell them to make money. To check your money look to the right side of your screen. When you start you can grab a starter pickaxe from the starter chest and enter the first area. Once you enter you will get effects to help you get to the top of the block of ore, you can also refill the giant block of ore by stepping on the pressure plate that says refill ore. You can use money to buy pickaxes, Keys, and Rebirths. Rebirths will give you gems and a coin multiplier. You can also check how many gems and rebirths you have by pressing the pause button(right next to the chat button). It will cycle between rebirths and gems. You can use gems to buy pets and effects. Rebirths also unlock areas as well. There are multiple areas such as coal, Iron, gold, and many more. Keys will unlock areas the first 3 areas iron, gold, and Diamonds. Different ores give different amounts of money. After you unlock diamonds the rest will be unlocked by Rebirths. Make sure to turn off auto jump because it can get annoying. There is a clear effects area near the door to enter the coal area make sure to use it if you don?t want the effects anymore. If you are making a YouTube video on this please give me credit for my build All you have to say isn?t ?it was built by RoyalLattice712? (NOT lettuce but Lattice). Also don?t post this on other websites and call it your build. I added a little twist to this game tho every few seconds instead of the cave collapsing a random person would get money and another random person would get gems.There are also super rebirths which cost 5 rebirths. They currently don?t do anything but they will in the future. I have added a new area where u mine prismarine ores? There is also a new pickaxe to go with that area and it is the prismarine pickaxe!\nThe Rules are:\nNO CHEATING\nNO TAKING MORE THAN ONE STARTER PICKAXE(unless you just got a rebirth)\nNO GIVING YOURSELF EFFECTS\nHAVE FUN\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/4232/images/mining-simulator_4.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/4232/images/mining-simulator_5.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/4232/images/mining-simulator_6.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/4232/images/mining-simulator_7.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mining-simulator_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/4232/mining-Simulator-update.mcworld"}],"uploadedBy":"RoyalLattice712","uploadedAt":"30 Mar, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.14","1.15 (beta)"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/mining-simulator-map/"},{"title":"EXE | The Bridge (Doubles) [Minigame]","briefDescription":"Defend your base, Go to the other teams base, Steal their points!This is a game that you must Steal points from the other team ...","Description":"","crawledImageUrls":[{"text":"Defend your base, Go to the other teams base, Steal their points!\nThis is a game that you must Steal points from the other team and first one to get 4 Points Wins!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/4807/images/exe--the-bridge--doubles--minigame_2.png"},{"text":"Map was created by: ExetreemPlayz\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/4807/images/exe--the-bridge--doubles--minigame_3.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/4807/images/exe--the-bridge--doubles--minigame_4.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/exe-the-bridge-doubles-minigame_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/4807/blE9XbE-r6_-eThe-Bridge.mcworld"}],"uploadedBy":"xLyv","uploadedAt":"29 Mar, 2020","supporteds":["1.14"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/exe-the-bridge-doubles-minigame/"},{"title":"Super Hard 20 Question Quiz (SH20QQ)","briefDescription":"This is my first map on MCPE DL.In this map you have to answer 20 questions.
