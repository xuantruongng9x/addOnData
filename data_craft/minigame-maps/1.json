Until it isn?t. Explore a giant house on a quest for mini games and emeralds. This map is different than most as you have to search for the things to do, like a game of hide and seek. You can also join the official realm which should be linked somewhere around here.\nHome Sweet Home is a mini-game realm/world that focuses on exploration. Run around a giant house searching for loot! Items and mini-games can be found anywhere from furniture, to snow globes, to aquariums! This map is also a joinable realm if you want to play with friends or fellow loot enthusiasts! The map can be a bit confusing but as long as you explore ALL of you surroundings everything will be okay.\nThere are currently 4 rooms with a total of 6 mini-games and our team is constantly updating the realm, with more updates coming here soon. There is also one hidden music disc for every game, and if you manage to find them all? well? something special will happen.\nCurrent Mini-games:\nParkour Paradise: Over 3 hours of parkour! Trust me I sat through it, well actually I was sprinting,,, Includes a spawn lobby that branches out into different levels\nCeiling Fan Skyblock: Generator based Skyblock that includes public mines, plots, islands, shops, and multiple worlds to explore.\nThe Labyrinth: A gigantic maze inside a? couch? Contains four endings and a potion shop to unlock new areas.\nBoat Racing: 2 race tracks, one looped and one finite, to try out! Includes auto boat reset system.\nJungle Hyjinx: Jungle Hyjinx is a survival mini-game set in, well a jungle duh.\nNether Factions: This is coming soon, but it will be free roaming of the entire nether.\nEvery game also has it?s own secrets and ways to earn emeralds. Spend emeralds on lottery tickets, crates or the shops.\nThere are currently four rooms to explore with more on the way, you just have to find them.\nThere will also be a Christmas Update on December 12th that is mostly for the realm.\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/msWSVeCSsY\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10380/images/home-sweet-home_4.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/10380/images/home-sweet-home_3.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/home-sweet-home_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/10380/CgHUX3CAgA.mcworld"}],"uploadedBy":"Shadowy Fox","uploadedAt":"10 Dec, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.16","1.16.100","1.16.101","1.16.200"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/home-sweet-home-map-1/"},{"title":"Sword Battle Wars","briefDescription":"Sword Battle Wars is a Last Man Standing Minigame.

In this minigame, players have to fight each other with swords and kill each other until one player is remaining. It also has a lot of cool and unique ways to get around the map, and some Game modes!\nNormal Game mode:\nSword Battle Wars is a PvP Last man standing minigame with wooden swords. To kill someone, you must knock them of the edge into the floor (more specifically, y coordinate 4) or kill them with your sword. Every couple of seconds you get a random chance of getting a random enchantment (unbreaking, knockback, sharpness, and fire aspect) which will help you kill your opponents, you also have a random chance to get speed for 3 seconds which can help you either escape someone or get closer to someone.\nCreepy Crawlers Game mode (Halloween Themed):\nIn Creepy Crawlers, spiders spawn almost everywhere around the city, your goal is to be the last player standing and fend of the spiders with stone swords and random enchantments (unbreaking, knockback, bane of arthropods or fire aspect). PvP is also turned off in this game, this means that you can team up with your friends to Conquer the spiders, but one by, everyone will die shortly after. Only one player can win in this mode, so make sure you?re the one who doesn?t get bitten to death, or fall from the Buildings!\n(Spiders also get Speed, Strength, and resistance. Which makes them have more health, makes them stronger, and also makes them faster. Also this game mode is NOT recommended for low end devices.)\nMini-Game modes:\nMini-Game modes are settings you can activate and will be added for any game mode. For example? If you want to activate elytra for any game mode, then go ahead!\nTrailer for sword battle wars coming to my YouTube channel sometime in the future.\nI am the ORIGINAL creator of this world.\nSettings:\nIn the settings, you can change where the wins appear, camera shake, time of day, etc. to your preference!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/8914/images/sword-battle-wars_3.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/8914/images/sword-battle-wars_4.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/8914/images/sword-battle-wars_5.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/8914/images/sword-battle-wars_6.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/8914/images/sword-battle-wars_8.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sword-battle-wars_1-1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/8914/SwordBattleWarsv1.0.4.zip"},{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/8914/SwordBattleWarsv1.0.2"},{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/8914/SwordBattleWarsv1.0.3"},{"href":"https://www.mediafire.com/file/lzsd97vdd1lmobd/SwordBattleWars%255Bv1.0.5%255D%255B1%255D.zip/file"},{"href":"http://www.mediafire.com/file/bx7m607uksdq6ua/SwordBattleWars%257Bv1.0.6%255D.zip/file"}],"uploadedBy":"ItsxX250VIPXx","uploadedAt":"25 Sep, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.16"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/sword-battle-wars/"},{"title":"Lucky Block SkyWars","briefDescription":"Lucky Block SkyWars is a game of skywars with lucky blocks!
