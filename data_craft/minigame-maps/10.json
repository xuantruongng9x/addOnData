The compass, when dropped as an entity, will face Hunter #1 towards the direction of Runner #1, and the clock does the same for Hunter #2 and Runner #2. Make sure to sleep in a bed to set your spawn point, or else you will have to travel farther in order to catch up with the runner(s).\nRunners:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/4312/images/minecraft-manhunt_8.png"},{"text":"Run as far as you can, don?t let the hunters kill you.

If you beat the ender dragon without dying, you win.\nSuggestions:\nYou can have multiple people be the same hunter, that is fine. A side effect of this would be that whenever the compass/clock is dropped, all hunters of the same type would face the corresponding runner. but multiple of the same runner won?t work because of how the command blocks work. If you want to learn how the command blocks work, you can keep reading. If you want more than two runners, just make a rule that the untracked player cant be too far away from the others.\nModifiers:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/4312/images/minecraft-manhunt_9.png"},{"text":"If you want to make it harder for the hunters, then give the runners ! extra life, a head start, an extra player, whatever you want.\nIf you want to make it harder for the Runners, give the Hunter?s a starting kit, keep inventory, or some potion effects.\nIf you play this a-lot and don?t want to go to the same strongholds, teleport a few thousand blacks in a direction, or multiple directions, after you assign roles.
