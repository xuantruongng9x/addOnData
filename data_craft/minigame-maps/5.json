On the central tower is at its top a beacon to bring back and put at home while, on the opposite towers spawn iron ingots and lapis lazuli: practical for your armor and your enchantments! The endless battle for control of the ?mid? can begin\nPresentation: The Towers is a map created by DragonNoirFRYtB whose concept is quite simple: your objective will be to enter the opposing camp and score points by breaking the glass block and throwing yourself into a kind of pool located in the heart of the enemy base. The first team to score 3 points wins the game!\nYou can use crafts.\nYou can place and destroy as many blocks as you want.\nYou can loot enemy chests, but not destroy them.\nYou will find minecarts at TNT, you are prohibited from destroying opposing chests with them.\nOur little tips:\nAccording to the author, the map is made for teams of 3 to 5 players.\nIron armor will be very useful for offense as well as defense: think about it!\nFor the attack:\nQuick attacks on their own as bait can occupy a few opponents while other teammates pass.\nKamikaze attacks will only be effective if you take something away from the opposing team: eat their apples, drink their potions, loot their chests ?\nOnly take the important stuff when you think it is necessary! You only have one chance with it.\nIf you feel like you?re going to die, throw yourself into the void rather than giving your opponent free stuff.\nFor the defense:\nProtect your pool by surrounding it with blocks, by solidifying its roof ? Make it difficult to access by laying slabs underneath, by removing the stairs that lead to it ?\nIf you get to the middle first, try to protect the latter as much as possible with blocks (preferably wood), to delay the opposing team.\nIn order to prevent theft in your safe room as much as possible, break the glass and completely isolate the room with blocks: only one entry / exit!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/8552/images/thetower_3.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thetower_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/8552/1The7To4wer_1598859740.mcworld"},{"href":"https://www.clipeee.com/creator/dragonnoirfrytb"}],"uploadedBy":"DragonNoirFRYtB","uploadedAt":"1 Sep, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.10","1.11","1.12","1.13","1.14","1.15 (beta)","1.16","1.6","1.7","1.8","1.9"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/thetower-map/"},{"title":"Range Battle 1.0 (Team Deathmatch Minigame)","briefDescription":"Are you bored with previous minigames?

Burning maps have been widely popular on the java edition and many have started to die out on Bedrock. Enjoy an old game that has been refurbished with new game mechanics.\nYoutubers like Popularmmos used to play these maps back in 2017 or so. This map may bring you complete nostalgia to those who remember the old days of burning maps.\nWhat is a burning map?\nA burning map is a mini-game that takes place in a large burnable structure, where lava will pour down upon it. Play with your friends and see who can survive the longest.\nHow To Play:\nA burning map is a free-for all mini-game that you can play with your friends. First, you select a class you would like to play as, and the game is ready to be played.\nOnce you have selected your class, you can start the game and everyone will teleport into the structure, where lava will begin to pour onto it.\nThe objective is to survive the longest and be the last one surviving.\nInside the structure will be hidden loot and areas to hide in.\nThe map can also rest, so you can play as many rounds as you like! (However the more resets, the more lag)\nAre there any rules?\nNot exactly! You may make up your own rules to the game!\nThere are a few rules however:\nSome rules are default enabled like PvP off and things like that. You are free to enable whatever game-rules you?d like!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7946/images/burn-the-enderman-v1_3.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7946/images/burn-the-enderman-v1_4.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7946/images/burn-the-enderman-v1_2.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/burn-the-enderman-v1_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/7946/Burn-The-Enderman_1596754537.mcworld"}],"uploadedBy":"wer5624","uploadedAt":"9 Aug, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.16"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/burn-the-enderman-v1/"},{"title":"NoHitDelay","briefDescription":"Did you ever wanted no delay/unlimited combos, well now you can, It makes you fly in the air with out any effects, This is ...","Description":"","crawledImageUrls":[{"text":"Did you ever wanted no delay/unlimited combos, well now you can, It makes you fly in the air with out any effects, This is called nohitdelay, and this was only available for java/bedrock server but not you can have it in your lan world and realms, in other world its called combo hit\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7922/images/nohitdelay_2.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nohitdelay_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/7922/bS6UbM6O-cNoHitDelay.mcworld"}],"uploadedBy":"zucs","uploadedAt":"5 Aug, 2020","supporteds":["1.16"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/nohitdelay-map/"}]
