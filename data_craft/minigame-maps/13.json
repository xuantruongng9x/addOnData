This is not your standard prison, and it includes a custom escape route, mines with resets, a town to escape to, and even a way to help break out your fellow prisoners.\nPart 1: Get some friends (The hard part)\nPart 2 : Play\nHow it works is that the Operators are the prison guards and control the prison. They should still stay in survival mode at all times. It is their job to make sure that the prisoners follow their daily routines and do not try to escape. If a prisoner is bad, you can put them in solitary confinement. If they behave, you can take them to the well-behaved prisoner wing. Instructions for the prisoners on how to escape are provided in-game. You can hunt escaped prisoners by following them to town. (Enter the path to town in the yard of the well-behaved prisoner wing)\nPICTURES:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/790/images/bouncy-castle-correctional-facilities-prison_4.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/790/images/bouncy-castle-correctional-facilities-prison_2.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/790/images/bouncy-castle-correctional-facilities-prison_3.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bouncy-castle-correctional-facilities-prison_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/790/8lPS-Prison.mcworld"},{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/790/8lPS-Prison.mcworld"},{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/790/8lPS-Prison.mcworld"}],"uploadedBy":"PotatoStudios","uploadedAt":"16 Mar, 2019 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.10","1.11","1.6","1.7","1.8","1.9"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/bouncy-castle-correctional-facilities-prison/"},{"title":"Bomb Defuse [MiniGame] v1.2","briefDescription":"FvDisco\u0027s awesome Bomb defuse mini game completely rebuilt to work in Bedrock edition!Defuse the bomb before it explodes!Bomb Defuse Map Features:Live TNT (...","Description":"","crawledImageUrls":[{"text":"FvDisco?s awesome Bomb defuse mini game completely rebuilt to work in Bedrock edition!\nDefuse the bomb before it explodes!\nBomb Defuse Map Features:\n*Resettable*\nSimulation Distance: 8 or higher.\nObjective: Select wires to cut, then hit the test button.
