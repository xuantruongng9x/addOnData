It features 23 zones, 54 levels, 13 special stages and four playable characters. The game also includes new features such as springs, more boss fights, new monitors, cutscenes, music (though you have to play the music first), among other things, too.\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 revolves around Sonic?s best friend, Tails, being captured by the infamous Dr. Robotnik. Sonic must save Tails by collecting all seven of the Time Stones and putting an end to Robotnik?s evil schemes.\nTo collect Time Stones, you must travel to (and complete) seven special stages. Each special stage you complete awards you one Time Stone. You also may collect Chaos Emeralds from the last six special stages, though all they do is unlock bonus content.\nOne of the major new features added in Sonic 2 is saving. You can create and delete up to three save files. If you unlock a character on one save file, that character becomes available for all save files.\nOn your journey, you may come across a cutscene. You?ll have to press the button at the front of the room to start the cutscene first, but other than that, it?s automatic. If you don?t want to watch the cutscene, you have the option to skip it.\nIt took three months to make Sonic 2.

Well this is the map for you! We have 8 different characters and a giant map for you and your friends to battle on! This game is for EVERYONE whether you like to heal your teammates, tank all the attacks or deal a lot of damage!\nYou this map was made by HarryAlire, in a week, then updated to add more characters and more story to it!\nPLUNDER is a minigame in mcpe that HarryAlire has made. It is a team building, point progression game, The more you are on the point, the more points you get. 100 points to win. And if both teams are on the point, no one gets points until there is only 1 team left on the point! I recommend playing 2v2 or 3v3 (no more) but 1v1 if you have to.\nYou start by pressing the start button, then choosing a character, taking your items. THen you will realise that you will have abilities or barriers in your inventory, these can be dropped when fully charged to unleash a full on ability. It can be something from a healing ability to full on strength! It varies depending on which character you choose!\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/6117/images/plunder--harryalire_3.png"},{"text":"To win the game you need to get 100 points, and you get points while you are on the objective, if both teams are on the objective then no one gets points until there is only one team left on the objective.\nAt this stage there is only 1 map and 8 characters, but if this gets attention I;ll add more maps and more characters!!\nI hope you enjoy this map as much as i enjoyed making it!!\nBring some friends along and you?ll have the time of your life on this map, honestly it is soooooo much fun to play.\nIt isn?t a very big map but I am determined to make it better and better as it goes along.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/6117/images/plunder--harryalire_4.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/plunder-harryalire_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/6117/dlPLUNDER-r_-6HarryAlire.mcworld"},{"href":"https://youtu.be/nSZPO9reeqc"}],"uploadedBy":"HarryAlire","uploadedAt":"31 May, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.11","1.12","1.13","1.14"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/plunder-pvp-minigame/"},{"title":"Pacify Horror Game","briefDescription":"Hey how\u0027s it going guys I\u0027m RJH4den!!This map is based on the real game called Pacify, and it\u0027s really scary from the people ...","Description":"","crawledImageUrls":[{"text":"Hey how?s it going guys I?m RJH4den!!\nThis map is based on the real game called Pacify, and it?s really scary from the people who tested my map.\nWarning: contains loud sounds, jumpscares!!\nSubsribe: RJH4denYT\nThis map can be played multiplayer, and needs good strategy.

If yes, then you?re in luck because we recreated the same concept on minecraft bedrock edition for you to try for yourself.\nYou and your opponent will be teleported to random places in the world. Your goal is to kill the other person without contact. You swap places in the world every 3-7 minutes. You have to put them in a dangerous place right before you swap! You could make them fall in lava, drop them off a cliff, or even blow them up in a desert temple.\nNote: This map is for two players only. The map will break if you use more or less than 2 players. Also, if your game lags after pressing the start button, wait till you receive the message telling you to leave, then quickly relog (leave the world and rejoin) then immediately invite the other player (This should only be an issue on low end devices).\nThis Death Swap map was created by ThanPixel and BlueSlimeMC. BlueSlimeMC wrote the commands and ThanPixel created the head resource pack and builds. The resource pack used for the floating texts was created by Keyyard, you can download it from mcpedl here.
