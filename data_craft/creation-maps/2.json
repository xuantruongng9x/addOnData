The building is built up by 5 main segments which are stacked up on each other. In the middle it forms the atrium/lobby with a smooth bending glass roof.\nThis building took me around 2 days to build and complete. It took a few tries until I managed to get it right. It include the front entrance with the road, the entrance to the subway system (not included), the outdoor cafeteria area, the public art sculpture and and outdoor plaza.\nThe main lobby is also built within the building, there you can also find the cafeteria seating and the modern design of the interior. Examples of these are the funky purple coaches.
