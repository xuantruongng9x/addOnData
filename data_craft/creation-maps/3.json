Here you can do 3 different things. Explore, Give her a flower, Find secrets and Easter eggs I put in so there is additional content :).\nHello and Welcome :D. So.. I built Modeus(From Helltaker) and I?m usually a bad builder or pixel art Maker but I?m pretty proud with this one. There is not much to do here, but you can give her a flower, Take a better look of her, And very much explore the map to find some secrets and Easter eggs I put in. You may find someone, or something that reveals a? not so much of a secret of me ;). I?ll add more and design the place a little bit in the future but this is all I can do for now.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7602/images/altarstatue-of-modeusfrom-helltaker_4.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/altarstatue-of-modeusfrom-helltaker_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/7602/Altar-or-Statue-For-Modeus-from-Helltaker.mcworld"},{"href":"https://www.mediafire.com/file/ck0w3njdy0sym64/Altar+or+Statue+For+Modeus.mcworld/file"}],"uploadedBy":"ItzGamebystYT","uploadedAt":"24 Jul, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.16"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/altar-statue-of-modeus-from-helltaker/"},{"title":"Custom Universal Park MCPE (Creation) v2","briefDescription":"Welcome to my custom version of universal with islands of adventure and universal studios combined into one park.
