Press the button to buy.\nYou will also notice the ?map lock? I mentioned in RGBY Parkour 2 is gone, this is because access to information is a human right. It is always a good idea to complete previous maps, however.\nThere is also a fixed number of three checkpoints in each level, balancing its difficulty. They are now 5?3 platforms, so no more ?Checkpoint reached!? messages annoying you.\nAfter you finish the main parkour, you will have the opportunity to try out the Extra Stage, which is extremely difficult and filled with novel gimmick jumps, and the whole level is designed as a good end to the map series, as you can tell from a variety of things, such as checkpoint design and block palette. Speed potions are not sold in this level, and you can complete it without using them.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/5145/images/rgby-parkour-3_5.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rgby-parkour-3_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/5145/rgby_parkour_3_new_1598513409.mcworld"}],"uploadedBy":"Sleepyhead101","uploadedAt":"13 Apr, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.12","1.13","1.14","1.16"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/rgby-parkour-3/"},{"title":"Crucible Cubes Parkour (Very Hard)","briefDescription":"Crucible Cubes - a 8-level hardcore parkour map filled with hard parkour, as you would expect.

Cube 1 is easy, but there are sparse checkpoints. Cube 3 is built in the ?rankup style?, meaning it has a beginning, various sections, transitions which are life or death, as well as a sky. which when failed, forces you to start the course all over again.\nAfter cube 3, the levels get exponentially harder than each one before it.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/8389/images/crucible-cubes_4.png"},{"text":"Cube 4. You can practise the fundamentals here before moving onto harder levels.\nThe final 3 (or 4 if you are not that good) levels are very difficult and you are almost guaranteed to rage multiple times.
