This can be used to have a quick way of respawning from a high height instead of using The ?Un-Alive? Machine 9000.\nInvisibility toggles the ability to be turned invisible. This is used when there are too many people to see the parkour. You will still be see others because everyone will be equiped with leather boots.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/5448/images/5x5-parkour_2.png"},{"text":"Here are some additional pictures here to see what the parkour looks like:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/5448/images/5x5-parkour_3.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/5448/images/5x5-parkour_4.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/5448/images/5x5-parkour_5.png"},{"text":"","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/5448/images/5x5-parkour_6.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5x5-parkour-new-features_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/5448/5x5-aParkour-NEW-FEATURES_1592584394.mcworld"}],"uploadedBy":"noblais","uploadedAt":"24 Apr, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.14"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/5x5-parkour/"},{"title":"Raid The Ocean Temple!

This is re-playable and supports multiplayer! Also See if you can find the hidden barrier blocks(they make life easier)!\nDer Grobe Krieg (translates to The Great War) Is based on the battlefields of world war 1! Someone or something has poisoned the area we/I(the player or players) must escape. everyone has changed?\nThey are living dead? In this map you do a world war 1 themed parkour throughout the map zombies will spawn as they try to stop you getting to the end when you kill a zombie you will receive rotten flesh which you can sell for points these can then be spent at checkpoints throughout the map. Also at these checkpoints you can buy items with points. There are a total of 3 checkpoints throughout the map however there are more re-spawn points.\nThere are special blocks throughout the map these are black and green blocks green will give you poison and black will give you wither effect. Also there is hidden barrier blocks they are secret and make the map easier so good luck finding them. You can play this map solo or multiplayer(as many people as you want). The boss battle at the end is 2 waves of different mobs it is hard however you re-spawn in the boss arena when you die! I Plan to make a sequel to this map even though this was a small project.\nThis is my first public bedrock map and hope you enjoy if you have any bugs let me know and i will happily take any feedback and suggestions for the map.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/6749/images/der-grobe-krieg--zombie-parkour_2.png"},{"text":"This Map Features:\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/6749/images/der-grobe-krieg--zombie-parkour_4.png"}],"imageUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/der-grobe-krieg-zombie-parkour_1-520x245.png","downloadUrls":[{"href":"https://dl.mcpedl.com/worlds/6749/4der-grobe-Krieg-3WW1Parkour_1592249002.mcworld"}],"uploadedBy":"MACE","uploadedAt":"17 Jun, 2020 (Updated)","supporteds":["1.14"],"originUrl":"https://mcpedl.com/der-grobe-krieg-zombie-parkour/"},{"title":"Biomes Parkour","briefDescription":"Welcome to Biomes Parkour!
