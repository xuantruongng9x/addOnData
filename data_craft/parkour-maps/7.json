Featuring: Even more difficulty, a larger variety of jumps, larger levels and an actual prize. Beating this map is a good way to prove your parkour skill.\nWelcome to RGBY Parkour 2! This map is quite different from the original in a different ways. The start portal has been removed, replaced by pressure plates directly teleporting you to the start of levels.\nOne of the most important features added is the work system. You can mine cobblestone at a generator, exchange the cobblestone into emeralds which can be used to buy speed 2 potions at Blue and upper. You are reminded that some jumps require speed to complete (e.g. the final jump of Yellow), but most do not. Important: DO NOT exchange your cobblestone until you have at least 20 cobblestone. Due to command limitations, attempting to exchange for emeralds with 19 or less cobblestone will result in all of your cobblestone disappearing.\nThe speed potion vending machine is at the start of Blue, Yellow and Green levels.
