You dreamed of traveling to the unknown! Today it is possible you can go on an extreme adventure in the Pyramid on the Pyramid Jump map.\nPyramid Jump is a parkour map with small elements of puzzles. The map is simple but sometimes it can be troublesome for you.\nRecently, browsing YouTube, I found videos with an interesting map Pyramid Parkour. Inspired, I decided that he would also create something like that. The map has 22 levels, so it is shorter than the Pyramid Parkour map. I wanted the map to reflect the old climate of map creation.\nThe pyramid is 100 by 100, so it?s really big. Do you want to join this desert adventure? Few worlds of building this huge pyramid say that it was created on the order of the minecraft Pharaoh himself, who in order not to get to it had to build difficult parkour.\nDo you want to find out more information about my map? Go down\nAs I mentioned before, the pyramid was demolished on the orders of the minecraft pharaoh himself. A few years after the end of the pyramid, Pharaoh died. Before his death, he ordered his corpse buried in a pyramid and fenced off with a difficult parkour?\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/5476/images/pyramid-jump_2.png"},{"text":"End of story I have to tell you something about my map!
