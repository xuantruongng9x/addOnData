If it?s in their world or a world they downloaded, we have done some parkour in our Minecraft lives. In this world you start off by doing a parkour at a tree and ending off at the celebration of the defeating the Ender dragon.\nThis is just like any box world. Only this one has a little story to it.\nThis is a 30 level world. Every level is in a 7?7 box. You will start off at the bottom and make your way to the top to move on to the next level. The 1st box is a tree, then you will move on to finding diamonds fighting the wither and the Ender dragon and end off celebrating. There will be more boxes like a biome explorer box and a trading hall box.\nYou will spawn with the saturation effect. This will make it so if you fall and take damage, you don?t have to eat in order to get more health.\nSome Nether boxes have lava and all end boxes have a void. If you die at levels 1-10, you will re spawn at level 1. If you die at level 11-30 you will re spawn at level 11 so be careful.\nThere are three levels where you need a bow. When you get to level 14 ?get the skulls? you will get a bow and arrow. The bow has infinity, you will need to keep the bow for levels 17, ?Wither fight? and level 25 ?dragon fight?.\nYou will be given op just in case you want to look around or if you keep dying and want to move on.\nMy next world will be a Minekart Wii (Mariokart Wii) Just for a shout out.\nThank you Flipndip257 for play testing.

The glass floors and tight corners will prove to be difficult, so watch your step!

Throughout this map you will have to block clutch in exact areas with the max being a double block clutch. Furthermore, this map helps you improve your bowing \u0026 PvP combo accuracy in 2 main challenges.\nThere are 8 main challenges in this world that consist of:\n? 4 Block clutch sections\n? 1 Bow accuracy section\n? 1 PvP combo section\n? 1 Ender Pearl, practice section\n? 1 PvP on bridge practice section\nBlock clutching: (Green blocks mean you have to double block clutch)\n?

You will have speed, the skeleton will have feather falling. Your goal is to practice your combos by keeping it in the air (using your punches) while dodging its arrows. If it hits the ground hold out the fishing rod (9th slot) to effect the skeleton with levitation for 2 seconds. Only use the fishing rod if it?s about to hit the ground.\n","url":"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7779/images/hard-block-clutch--pvp-practice-world_4.png"},{"text":"Ender pearl practice\n?
