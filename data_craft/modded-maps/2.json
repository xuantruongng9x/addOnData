Expect major updates weekly.\nYour standard slime! Generates XP every 10000 ticks.\nUnlike the actual game, phosphor slimes spawn during the day and can go out in sunlight. Generates XP every 9000 ticks.\nRock slimes are extremely slow, but can hurt you pretty bad with their spikes. Generates XP every 8000 ticks.\nThe cutest of the bunch, but also the most ferocious. Keep your distance while capturing! Generates XP every 7500 ticks.\nThe puddle slime is a slime that can only be found on Ring Island.
